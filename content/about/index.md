Bird? Bird!

Hello this is Shu, welcome to my tavern :D 

Not like other taverns, there only have milk offered, grab some anytime you want

To build this tavern, it really took me a lot of time so pls lemme give my treasure appreciation to [gohugo - The world’s fastest framework for building websites](https://gohugo.io) and [blowfish - A powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo](https://blowfish.page)

You may want to know what the meaning of Shu is and why ~~(or not but I will keep saying because you have to read lol)~~, [Shuzo "Shu" Matsutani](https://legendz.fandom.com/wiki/Shu) (シュウゾウ・マツタニ Shūzō Matsutani) is the "Kaze no Saga" or "Wind Saga" from the anime [Legendz: Tale of the Dragon Kings](https://legendz.fandom.com/wiki/Legendz_(Anime)) (レジェンズ 甦る竜王伝説 Rejenzu Yomigaeru Ryūō Densetsu)., tho he is very absent-minded and irresponsible but you will know he is not what you saw if you watch more, gotta say I wanna be like him bc I am shy irl, and the wind, I like the wind, it makes me feel comfort and happy <3

I play Minecraft and ign is MeWannaFly, I am more like a builder and like to explore the world.

For the future of this tavern, I have no idea for now, but I will keep my work when I finish all the stuff these days, so please wait <3

Thank you for coming here and reading, you are cool B)
