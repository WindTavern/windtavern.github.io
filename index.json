Nello was a little Ardennois\u0026ndash;Patrasche was a big Fleming. They were both of the same age by length of years, yet one was still young, and the other was already old. They had dwelt together almost all their days: both were orphaned and destitute, and owed their lives to the same hand. It had been the beginning of the tie between them, their first bond of sympathy; and it had strengthened day by day, and had grown with their growth, firm and indissoluble, until they loved one another very greatly. Their home was a little hut on the edge of a little village\u0026ndash;a Flemish village a league from Antwerp, set amidst flat breadths of pasture and corn-lands, with long lines of poplars and of alders bending in the breeze on the edge of the great canal which ran through it. It had about a score of houses and homesteads, with shutters of bright green or sky-blue, and roofs rose-red or black and white, and walls white-washed until they shone in the sun like snow. In the centre of the village stood a windmill, placed on a little moss-grown slope: it was a landmark to all the level country round. It had once been painted scarlet, sails and all, but that had been in its infancy, half a century or more earlier, when it had ground wheat for the soldiers of Napoleon; and it was now a ruddy brown, tanned by wind and weather. It went queerly by fits and starts, as though rheumatic and stiff in the joints from age, but it served the whole neighborhood, which would have thought it almost as impious to carry grain elsewhere as to attend any other religious service than the mass that was performed at the altar of the little old gray church, with its conical steeple, which stood opposite to it, and whose single bell rang morning, noon, and night with that strange, subdued, hollow sadness which every bell that hangs in the Low Countries seems to gain as an integral part of its melody.\nWithin sound of the little melancholy clock almost from their birth upward, they had dwelt together, Nello and Patrasche, in the little hut on the edge of the village, with the cathedral spire of Antwerp rising in the north-east, beyond the great green plain of seeding grass and spreading corn that stretched away from them like a tideless, changeless sea. It was the hut of a very old man, of a very poor man\u0026ndash;of old Jehan Daas, who in his time had been a soldier, and who remembered the wars that had trampled the country as oxen tread down the furrows, and who had brought from his service nothing except a wound, which had made him a cripple.\nWhen old Jehan Daas had reached his full eighty, his daughter had died in the Ardennes, hard by Stavelot, and had left him in legacy her two-year-old son. The old man could ill contrive to support himself, but he took up the additional burden uncomplainingly, and it soon became welcome and precious to him. Little Nello\u0026mdash;which was but a pet diminutive for Nicolas\u0026ndash;throve with him, and the old man and the little child lived in the poor little hut contentedly.\nIt was a very humble little mud-hut indeed, but it was clean and white as a sea-shell, and stood in a small plot of garden-ground that yielded beans and herbs and pumpkins. They were very poor, terribly poor\u0026ndash;many a day they had nothing at all to eat. They never by any chance had enough: to have had enough to eat would have been to have reached paradise at once. But the old man was very gentle and good to the boy, and the boy was a beautiful, innocent, truthful, tender-hearted creature; and they were happy on a crust and a few leaves of cabbage, and asked no more of earth or heaven; save indeed that Patrasche should be always with them, since without Patrasche where would they have been?\nFor Patrasche was their alpha and omega; their treasury and granary; their store of gold and wand of wealth; their bread-winner and minister; their only friend and comforter. Patrasche dead or gone from them, they must have laid themselves down and died likewise. Patrasche was body, brains, hands, head, and feet to both of them: Patrasche was their very life, their very soul. For Jehan Daas was old and a cripple, and Nello was but a child; and Patrasche was their dog.\nA dog of Flanders\u0026ndash;yellow of hide, large of head and limb, with wolf-like ears that stood erect, and legs bowed and feet widened in the muscular development wrought in his breed by many generations of hard service. Patrasche came of a race which had toiled hard and cruelly from sire to son in Flanders many a century\u0026ndash;slaves of slaves, dogs of the people, beasts of the shafts and the harness, creatures that lived straining their sinews in the gall of the cart, and died breaking their hearts on the flints of the streets.\nPatrasche had been born of parents who had labored hard all their days over the sharp-set stones of the various cities and the long, shadowless, weary roads of the two Flanders and of Brabant. He had been born to no other heritage than those of pain and of toil. He had been fed on curses and baptized with blows. Why not? It was a Christian country, and Patrasche was but a dog. Before he was fully grown he had known the bitter gall of the cart and the collar. Before he had entered his thirteenth month he had become the property of a hardware-dealer, who was accustomed to wander over the land north and south, from the blue sea to the green mountains. They sold him for a small price, because he was so young.\nThis man was a drunkard and a brute. The life of Patrasche was a life of hell. To deal the tortures of hell on the animal creation is a way which the Christians have of showing their belief in it. His purchaser was a sullen, ill-living, brutal Brabantois, who heaped his cart full with pots and pans and flagons and buckets, and other wares of crockery and brass and tin, and left Patrasche to draw the load as best he might, whilst he himself lounged idly by the side in fat and sluggish ease, smoking his black pipe and stopping at every wineshop or café on the road.\nHappily for Patrasche\u0026ndash;or unhappily\u0026ndash;he was very strong: he came of an iron race, long born and bred to such cruel travail; so that he did not die, but managed to drag on a wretched existence under the brutal burdens, the scarifying lashes, the hunger, the thirst, the blows, the curses, and the exhaustion which are the only wages with which the Flemings repay the most patient and laborious of all their four-footed victims. One day, after two years of this long and deadly agony, Patrasche was going on as usual along one of the straight, dusty, unlovely roads that lead to the city of Rubens. It was full midsummer, and very warm. His cart was very heavy, piled high with goods in metal and in earthenware. His owner sauntered on without noticing him otherwise than by the crack of the whip as it curled round his quivering loins. The Brabantois had paused to drink beer himself at every wayside house, but he had forbidden Patrasche to stop a moment for a draught from the canal. Going along thus, in the full sun, on a scorching highway, having eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, and, which was far worse to him, not having tasted water for near twelve, being blind with dust, sore with blows, and stupefied with the merciless weight which dragged upon his loins, Patrasche staggered and foamed a little at the mouth, and fell.\nHe fell in the middle of the white, dusty road, in the full glare of the sun; he was sick unto death, and motionless. His master gave him the only medicine in his pharmacy\u0026ndash;kicks and oaths and blows with a cudgel of oak, which had been often the only food and drink, the only wage and reward, ever offered to him. But Patrasche was beyond the reach of any torture or of any curses. Patrasche lay, dead to all appearances, down in the white powder of the summer dust. After a while, finding it useless to assail his ribs with punishment and his ears with maledictions, the Brabantois\u0026ndash;deeming life gone in him, or going so nearly that his carcass was forever useless, unless indeed some one should strip it of the skin for gloves\u0026ndash;cursed him fiercely in farewell, struck off the leathern bands of the harness, kicked his body aside into the grass, and, groaning and muttering in savage wrath, pushed the cart lazily along the road up-hill, and left the dying dog for the ants to sting and for the crows to pick.\nIt was the last day before Kermesse away at Louvain, and the Brabantois was in haste to reach the fair and get a good place for his truck of brass wares. He was in fierce wrath, because Patrasche had been a strong and much-enduring animal, and because he himself had now the hard task of pushing his charette all the way to Louvain. But to stay to look after Patrasche never entered his thoughts: the beast was dying and useless, and he would steal, to replace him, the first large dog that he found wandering alone out of sight of its master. Patrasche had cost him nothing, or next to nothing, and for two long, cruel years had made him toil ceaselessly in his service from sunrise to sunset, through summer and winter, in fair weather and foul.\nHe had got a fair use and a good profit out of Patrasche: being human, he was wise, and left the dog to draw his last breath alone in the ditch, and have his bloodshot eyes plucked out as they might be by the birds, whilst he himself went on his way to beg and to steal, to eat and to drink, to dance and to sing, in the mirth at Louvain. A dying dog, a dog of the cart\u0026ndash;why should he waste hours over its agonies at peril of losing a handful of copper coins, at peril of a shout of laughter?\nPatrasche lay there, flung in the grass-green ditch. It was a busy road that day, and hundreds of people, on foot and on mules, in wagons or in carts, went by, tramping quickly and joyously on to Louvain. Some saw him, most did not even look: all passed on. A dead dog more or less\u0026ndash;it was nothing in Brabant: it would be nothing anywhere in the world.\nAfter a time, among the holiday-makers, there came a little old man who was bent and lame, and very feeble. He was in no guise for feasting: he was very poorly and miserably clad, and he dragged his silent way slowly through the dust among the pleasure-seekers. He looked at Patrasche, paused, wondered, turned aside, then kneeled down in the rank grass and weeds of the ditch, and surveyed the dog with kindly eyes of pity. There was with him a little rosy, fair-haired, dark-eyed child of a few years old, who pattered in amidst the bushes, for him breast-high, and stood gazing with a pretty seriousness upon the poor, great, quiet beast.\nThus it was that these two first met\u0026ndash;the little Nello and the big Patrasche.\nThe upshot of that day was, that old Jehan Daas, with much laborious effort, drew the sufferer homeward to his own little hut, which was a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw off amidst the fields, and there tended him with so much care that the sickness, which had been a brain seizure, brought on by heat and thirst and exhaustion, with time and shade and rest passed away, and health and strength returned, and Patrasche staggered up again upon his four stout, tawny legs.\nNow for many weeks he had been useless, powerless, sore, near to death; but all this time he had heard no rough word, had felt no harsh touch, but only the pitying murmurs of the child\u0026rsquo;s voice and the soothing caress of the old man\u0026rsquo;s hand.\nIn his sickness they too had grown to care for him, this lonely man and the little happy child. He had a corner of the hut, with a heap of dry grass for his bed; and they had learned to listen eagerly for his breathing in the dark night, to tell them that he lived; and when he first was well enough to essay a loud, hollow, broken bay, they laughed aloud, and almost wept together for joy at such a sign of his sure restoration; and little Nello, in delighted glee, hung round his rugged neck with chains of marguerites, and kissed him with fresh and ruddy lips.\nSo then, when Patrasche arose, himself again, strong, big, gaunt, powerful, his great wistful eyes had a gentle astonishment in them that there were no curses to rouse him and no blows to drive him; and his heart awakened to a mighty love, which never wavered once in its fidelity whilst life abode with him.\nBut Patrasche, being a dog, was grateful. Patrasche lay pondering long with grave, tender, musing brown eyes, watching the movements of his friends.\nNow, the old soldier, Jehan Daas, could do nothing for his living but limp about a little with a small cart, with which he carried daily the milk-cans of those happier neighbors who owned cattle away into the town of Antwerp. The villagers gave him the employment a little out of charity\u0026ndash;more because it suited them well to send their milk into the town by so honest a carrier, and bide at home themselves to look after their gardens, their cows, their poultry, or their little fields. But it was becoming hard work for the old man. He was eighty-three, and Antwerp was a good league off, or more.\nPatrasche watched the milk-cans come and go that one day when he had got well and was lying in the sun with the wreath of marguerites round his tawny neck.\nThe next morning, Patrasche, before the old man had touched the cart, arose and walked to it and placed himself betwixt its handles, and testified as plainly as dumb show could do his desire and his ability to work in return for the bread of charity that he had eaten. Jehan Daas resisted long, for the old man was one of those who thought it a foul shame to bind dogs to labor for which Nature never formed them. But Patrasche would not be gainsaid: finding they did not harness him, he tried to draw the cart onward with his teeth.\nAt length Jehan Daas gave way, vanquished by the persistence and the gratitude of this creature whom he had succored. He fashioned his cart so that Patrasche could run in it, and this he did every morning of his life thenceforward.\nWhen the winter came, Jehan Daas thanked the blessed fortune that had brought him to the dying dog in the ditch that fair-day of Louvain; for he was very old, and he grew feebler with each year, and he would ill have known how to pull his load of milk-cans over the snows and through the deep ruts in the mud if it had not been for the strength and the industry of the animal he had befriended. As for Patrasche, it seemed heaven to him. After the frightful burdens that his old master had compelled him to strain under, at the call of the whip at every step, it seemed nothing to him but amusement to step out with this little light green cart, with its bright brass cans, by the side of the gentle old man who always paid him with a tender caress and with a kindly word. Besides, his work was over by three or four in the day, and after that time he was free to do as he would\u0026ndash;to stretch himself, to sleep in the sun, to wander in the fields, to romp with the young child, or to play with his fellow-dogs. Patrasche was very happy.\nFortunately for his peace, his former owner was killed in a drunken brawl at the Kermesse of Mechlin, and so sought not after him nor disturbed him in his new and well-loved home.\nA few years later, old Jehan Daas, who had always been a cripple, became so paralyzed with rheumatism that it was impossible for him to go out with the cart any more. Then little Nello, being now grown to his sixth year of age, and knowing the town well from having accompanied his grandfather so many times, took his place beside the cart, and sold the milk and received the coins in exchange, and brought them back to their respective owners with a pretty grace and seriousness which charmed all who beheld him.\nThe little Ardennois was a beautiful child, with dark, grave, tender eyes, and a lovely bloom upon his face, and fair locks that clustered to his throat; and many an artist sketched the group as it went by him\u0026ndash;the green cart with the brass flagons of Teniers and Mieris and Van Tal, and the great tawny-colored, massive dog, with his belled harness that chimed cheerily as he went, and the small figure that ran beside him which had little white feet in great wooden shoes, and a soft, grave, innocent, happy face like the little fair children of Rubens.\nNello and Patrasche did the work so well and so joyfully together that Jehan Daas himself, when the summer came and he was better again, had no need to stir out, but could sit in the doorway in the sun and see them go forth through the garden wicket, and then doze and dream and pray a little, and then awake again as the clock tolled three and watch for their return. And on their return Patrasche would shake himself free of his harness with a bay of glee, and Nello would recount with pride the doings of the day; and they would all go in together to their meal of rye bread and milk or soup, and would see the shadows lengthen over the great plain, and see the twilight veil the fair cathedral spire; and then lie down together to sleep peacefully while the old man said a prayer. So the days and the years went on, and the lives of Nello and Patrasche were happy, innocent, and healthful. In the spring and summer especially were they glad. Flanders is not a lovely land, and around the burgh of Rubens it is perhaps least lovely of all. Corn and colza, pasture and plough, succeed each other on the characterless plain in wearying repetition, and save by some gaunt gray tower, with its peal of pathetic bells, or some figure coming athwart the fields, made picturesque by a gleaner\u0026rsquo;s bundle or a woodman\u0026rsquo;s fagot, there is no change, no variety, no beauty anywhere; and he who has dwelt upon the mountains or amidst the forests feels oppressed as by imprisonment with the tedium and the endlessness of that vast and dreary level. But it is green and very fertile, and it has wide horizons that have a certain charm of their own even in their dulness and monotony; and among the rushes by the water-side the flowers grow, and the trees rise tall and fresh where the barges glide with their great hulks black against the sun, and their little green barrels and vari-colored flags gay against the leaves. Anyway, there is greenery and breadth of space enough to be as good as beauty to a child and a dog; and these two asked no better, when their work was done, than to lie buried in the lush grasses on the side of the canal, and watch the cumbrous vessels drifting by and bring the crisp salt smell of the sea among the blossoming scents of the country summer.\nTrue, in the winter it was harder, and they had to rise in the darkness and the bitter cold, and they had seldom as much as they could have eaten any day, and the hut was scarce better than a shed when the nights were cold, although it looked so pretty in warm weather, buried in a great kindly clambering vine, that never bore fruit, indeed, but which covered it with luxuriant green tracery all through the months of blossom and harvest. In winter the winds found many holes in the walls of the poor little hut, and the vine was black and leafless, and the bare lands looked very bleak and drear without, and sometimes within the floor was flooded and then frozen. In winter it was hard, and the snow numbed the little white limbs of Nello, and the icicles cut the brave, untiring feet of Patrasche.\nBut even then they were never heard to lament, either of them. The child\u0026rsquo;s wooden shoes and the dog\u0026rsquo;s four legs would trot manfully together over the frozen fields to the chime of the bells on the harness; and then sometimes, in the streets of Antwerp, some housewife would bring them a bowl of soup and a handful of bread, or some kindly trader would throw some billets of fuel into the little cart as it went homeward, or some woman in their own village would bid them keep a share of the milk they carried for their own food; and they would run over the white lands, through the early darkness, bright and happy, and burst with a shout of joy into their home.\nSo, on the whole, it was well with them, very well; and Patrasche, meeting on the highway or in the public streets the many dogs who toiled from daybreak into nightfall, paid only with blows and curses, and loosened from the shafts with a kick to starve and freeze as best they might\u0026ndash;Patrasche in his heart was very grateful to his fate, and thought it the fairest and the kindliest the world could hold. Though he was often very hungry indeed when he lay down at night; though he had to work in the heats of summer noons and the rasping chills of winter dawns; though his feet were often tender with wounds from the sharp edges of the jagged pavement; though he had to perform tasks beyond his strength and against his nature\u0026ndash;yet he was grateful and content: he did his duty with each day, and the eyes that he loved smiled down on him. It was sufficient for Patrasche.\nThere was only one thing which caused Patrasche any uneasiness in his life, and it was this. Antwerp, as all the world knows, is full at every turn of old piles of stones, dark and ancient and majestic, standing in crooked courts, jammed against gateways and taverns, rising by the water\u0026rsquo;s edge, with bells ringing above them in the air, and ever and again out of their arched doors a swell of music pealing. There they remain, the grand old sanctuaries of the past, shut in amidst the squalor, the hurry, the crowds, the unloveliness, and the commerce of the modern world, and all day long the clouds drift and the birds circle and the winds sigh around them, and beneath the earth at their feet there sleeps\u0026ndash;RUBENS.\nAnd the greatness of the mighty Master still rests upon Antwerp, and wherever we turn in its narrow streets his glory lies therein, so that all mean things are thereby transfigured; and as we pace slowly through the winding ways, and by the edge of the stagnant water, and through the noisome courts, his spirit abides with us, and the heroic beauty of his visions is about us, and the stones that once felt his footsteps and bore his shadow seem to arise and speak of him with living voices. For the city which is the tomb of Rubens still lives to us through him, and him alone.\nIt is so quiet there by that great white sepulchre\u0026ndash;so quiet, save only when the organ peals and the choir cries aloud the Salve Regina or the Kyrie Eleison. Sure no artist ever had a greater gravestone than that pure marble sanctuary gives to him in the heart of his birthplace in the chancel of St. Jacques.\nWithout Rubens, what were Antwerp? A dirty, dusky, bustling mart, which no man would ever care to look upon save the traders who do business on its wharves. With Rubens, to the whole world of men it is a sacred name, a sacred soil, a Bethlehem where a god of Art saw light, a Golgotha where a god of Art lies dead.\nO nations! closely should you treasure your great men, for by them alone will the future know of you. Flanders in her generations has been wise. In his life she glorified this greatest of her sons, and in his death she magnifies his name. But her wisdom is very rare.\nNow, the trouble of Patrasche was this. Into these great, sad piles of stones, that reared their melancholy majesty above the crowded roofs, the child Nello would many and many a time enter, and disappear through their dark arched portals, whilst Patrasche, left without upon the pavement, would wearily and vainly ponder on what could be the charm which thus allured from him his inseparable and beloved companion. Once or twice he did essay to see for himself, clattering up the steps with his milk-cart behind him; but thereon he had been always sent back again summarily by a tall custodian in black clothes and silver chains of office; and fearful of bringing his little master into trouble, he desisted, and remained couched patiently before the churches until such time as the boy reappeared. It was not the fact of his going into them which disturbed Patrasche: he knew that people went to church: all the village went to the small, tumbledown, gray pile opposite the red windmill.\nWhat troubled him was that little Nello always looked strangely when he came out, always very flushed or very pale; and whenever he returned home after such visitations would sit silent and dreaming, not caring to play, but gazing out at the evening skies beyond the line of the canal, very subdued and almost sad.\nWhat was it? wondered Patrasche. He thought it could not be good or natural for the little lad to be so grave, and in his dumb fashion he tried all he could to keep Nello by him in the sunny fields or in the busy market-place. But to the churches Nello would go: most often of all would he go to the great cathedral; and Patrasche, left without on the stones by the iron fragments of Quentin Matsys\u0026rsquo;s gate, would stretch himself and yawn and sigh, and even howl now and then, all in vain, until the doors closed and the child perforce came forth again, and winding his arms about the dog\u0026rsquo;s neck would kiss him on his broad, tawney-colored forehead, and murmur always the same words: \u0026ldquo;If I could only see them, Patrasche!\u0026ndash;if I could only see them!\u0026rdquo;\nWhat were they? pondered Patrasche, looking up with large, wistful, sympathetic eyes.\nOne day, when the custodian was out of the way and the doors left ajar, he got in for a moment after his little friend and saw. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rdquo; were two great covered pictures on either side of the choir.\nNello was kneeling, rapt as in an ecstasy, before the altar-picture of the Assumption, and when he noticed Patrasche, and rose and drew the dog gently out into the air, his face was wet with tears, and he looked up at the veiled places as he passed them, and murmured to his companion, \u0026ldquo;It is so terrible not to see them, Patrasche, just because one is poor and cannot pay! He never meant that the poor should not see them when he painted them, I am sure. He would have had us see them any day, every day: that I am sure. And they keep them shrouded there\u0026ndash;shrouded in the dark, the beautiful things!\u0026ndash;and they never feel the light, and no eyes look on them, unless rich people come and pay. If I could only see them, I would be content to die.\u0026rdquo;\nBut he could not see them, and Patrasche could not help him, for to gain the silver piece that the church exacts as the price for looking on the glories of the Elevation of the Cross and the Descent of the Cross was a thing as utterly beyond the powers of either of them as it would have been to scale the heights of the cathedral spire. They had never so much as a sou to spare: if they cleared enough to get a little wood for the stove, a little broth for the pot, it was the utmost they could do. And yet the heart of the child was set in sore and endless longing upon beholding the greatness of the two veiled Rubens.\nThe whole soul of the little Ardennois thrilled and stirred with an absorbing passion for Art. Going on his ways through the old city in the early days before the sun or the people had risen, Nello, who looked only a little peasant-boy, with a great dog drawing milk to sell from door to door, was in a heaven of dreams whereof Rubens was the god. Nello, cold and hungry, with stockingless feet in wooden shoes, and the winter winds blowing among his curls and lifting his poor thin garments, was in a rapture of meditation, wherein all that he saw was the beautiful fair face of the Mary of the Assumption, with the waves of her golden hair lying upon her shoulders, and the light of an eternal sun shining down upon her brow. Nello, reared in poverty, and buffeted by fortune, and untaught in letters, and unheeded by men, had the compensation or the curse which is called Genius.\nNo one knew it. He as little as any. No one knew it. Only indeed Patrasche, who, being with him always, saw him draw with chalk upon the stones any and every thing that grew or breathed, heard him on his little bed of hay murmur all manner of timid, pathetic prayers to the spirit of the great Master; watched his gaze darken and his face radiate at the evening glow of sunset or the rosy rising of the dawn; and felt many and many a time the tears of a strange, nameless pain and joy, mingled together, fall hotly from the bright young eyes upon his own wrinkled yellow forehead.\n\u0026ldquo;I should go to my grave quite content if I thought, Nello, that when thou growest a man thou couldst own this hut and the little plot of ground, and labor for thyself, and be called Baas by thy neighbors,\u0026rdquo; said the old man Jehan many an hour from his bed. For to own a bit of soil, and to be called Baas\u0026ndash;master\u0026ndash;by the hamlet round, is to have achieved the highest ideal of a Flemish peasant; and the old soldier, who had wandered over all the earth in his youth, and had brought nothing back, deemed in his old age that to live and die on one spot in contented humility was the fairest fate he could desire for his darling. But Nello said nothing.\nThe same leaven was working in him that in other times begat Rubens and Jordaens and the Van Eycks, and all their wondrous tribe, and in times more recent begat in the green country of the Ardennes, where the Meuse washes the old walls of Dijon, the great artist of the Patroclus, whose genius is too near us for us aright to measure its divinity.\nNello dreamed of other things in the future than of tilling the little rood of earth, and living under the wattle roof, and being called Baas by neighbors a little poorer or a little less poor than himself. The cathedral spire, where it rose beyond the fields in the ruddy evening skies or in the dim, gray, misty mornings, said other things to him than this. But these he told only to Patrasche, whispering, childlike, his fancies in the dog\u0026rsquo;s ear when they went together at their work through the fogs of the daybreak, or lay together at their rest among the rustling rushes by the water\u0026rsquo;s side.\nFor such dreams are not easily shaped into speech to awake the slow sympathies of human auditors; and they would only have sorely perplexed and troubled the poor old man bedridden in his corner, who, for his part, whenever he had trodden the streets of Antwerp, had thought the daub of blue and red that they called a Madonna, on the walls of the wine-shop where he drank his sou\u0026rsquo;s worth of black beer, quite as good as any of the famous altar-pieces for which the stranger folk travelled far and wide into Flanders from every land on which the good sun shone.\nThere was only one other beside Patrasche to whom Nello could talk at all of his daring fantasies. This other was little Alois, who lived at the old red mill on the grassy mound, and whose father, the miller, was the best-to-do husbandman in all the village. Little Alois was only a pretty baby with soft round, rosy features, made lovely by those sweet dark eyes that the Spanish rule has left in so many a Flemish face, in testimony of the Alvan dominion, as Spanish art has left broadsown throughout the country majestic palaces and stately courts, gilded house-fronts and sculptured lintels\u0026ndash;histories in blazonry and poems in stone.\nLittle Alois was often with Nello and Patrasche. They played in the fields, they ran in the snow, they gathered the daisies and bilberries, they went up to the old gray church together, and they often sat together by the broad wood-fire in the mill-house. Little Alois, indeed, was the richest child in the hamlet. She had neither brother nor sister; her blue serge dress had never a hole in it; at Kermesse she had as many gilded nuts and Agni Dei in sugar as her hands could hold; and when she went up for her first communion her flaxen curls were covered with a cap of richest Mechlin lace, which had been her mother\u0026rsquo;s and her grandmother\u0026rsquo;s before it came to her. Men spoke already, though she had but twelve years, of the good wife she would be for their sons to woo and win; but she herself was a little gay, simple child, in nowise conscious of her heritage, and she loved no playfellows so well as Jehan Daas\u0026rsquo;s grandson and his dog.\nOne day her father, Baas Cogez, a good man, but somewhat stern, came on a pretty group in the long meadow behind the mill, where the aftermath had that day been cut. It was his little daughter sitting amidst the hay, with the great tawny head of Patrasche on her lap, and many wreaths of poppies and blue corn-flowers round them both: on a clean smooth slab of pine wood the boy Nello drew their likeness with a stick of charcoal.\nThe miller stood and looked at the portrait with tears in his eyes, it was so strangely like, and he loved his only child closely and well. Then he roughly chid the little girl for idling there whilst her mother needed her within, and sent her indoors crying and afraid: then, turning, he snatched the wood from Nello\u0026rsquo;s hands. \u0026ldquo;Dost do much of such folly?\u0026rdquo; he asked, but there was a tremble in his voice.\nNello colored and hung his head. \u0026ldquo;I draw everything I see,\u0026rdquo; he murmured.\nThe miller was silent: then he stretched his hand out with a franc in it. \u0026ldquo;It is folly, as I say, and evil waste of time: nevertheless, it is like Alois, and will please the house-mother. Take this silver bit for it and leave it for me.\u0026rdquo;\nThe color died out of the face of the young Ardennois; he lifted his head and put his hands behind his back. \u0026ldquo;Keep your money and the portrait both, Baas Cogez,\u0026rdquo; he said, simply. \u0026ldquo;You have been often good to me.\u0026rdquo; Then he called Patrasche to him, and walked away across the field.\n\u0026ldquo;I could have seen them with that franc,\u0026rdquo; he murmured to Patrasche, \u0026ldquo;but I could not sell her picture\u0026ndash;not even for them.\u0026rdquo;\nBaas Cogez went into his mill-house sore troubled in his mind. \u0026ldquo;That lad must not be so much with Alois,\u0026rdquo; he said to his wife that night. \u0026ldquo;Trouble may come of it hereafter: he is fifteen now, and she is twelve; and the boy is comely of face and form.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And he is a good lad and a loyal,\u0026rdquo; said the housewife, feasting her eyes on the piece of pine wood where it was throned above the chimney with a cuckoo clock in oak and a Calvary in wax.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I do not gainsay that,\u0026rdquo; said the miller, draining his pewter flagon.\n\u0026ldquo;Then, if what you think of were ever to come to pass,\u0026rdquo; said the wife, hesitatingly, \u0026ldquo;would it matter so much? She will have enough for both, and one cannot be better than happy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are a woman, and therefore a fool,\u0026rdquo; said the miller, harshly, striking his pipe on the table. \u0026ldquo;The lad is naught but a beggar, and, with these painter\u0026rsquo;s fancies, worse than a beggar. Have a care that they are not together in the future, or I will send the child to the surer keeping of the nuns of the Sacred Heart.\u0026rdquo;\nThe poor mother was terrified, and promised humbly to do his will. Not that she could bring herself altogether to separate the child from her favorite playmate, nor did the miller even desire that extreme of cruelty to a young lad who was guilty of nothing except poverty. But there were many ways in which little Alois was kept away from her chosen companion; and Nello, being a boy proud and quiet and sensitive, was quickly wounded, and ceased to turn his own steps and those of Patrasche, as he had been used to do with every moment of leisure, to the old red mill upon the slope. What his offence was he did not know: he supposed he had in some manner angered Baas Cogez by taking the portrait of Alois in the meadow; and when the child who loved him would run to him and nestle her hand in his, he would smile at her very sadly and say with a tender concern for her before himself, \u0026ldquo;Nay, Alois, do not anger your father. He thinks that I make you idle, dear, and he is not pleased that you should be with me. He is a good man and loves you well: we will not anger him, Alois.\u0026rdquo;\nBut it was with a sad heart that he said it, and the earth did not look so bright to him as it had used to do when he went out at sunrise under the poplars down the straight roads with Patrasche. The old red mill had been a landmark to him, and he had been used to pause by it, going and coming, for a cheery greeting with its people as her little flaxen head rose above the low mill-wicket, and her little rosy hands had held out a bone or a crust to Patrasche. Now the dog looked wistfully at a closed door, and the boy went on without pausing, with a pang at his heart, and the child sat within with tears dropping slowly on the knitting to which she was set on her little stool by the stove; and Baas Cogez, working among his sacks and his mill-gear, would harden his will and say to himself, \u0026ldquo;It is best so. The lad is all but a beggar, and full of idle, dreaming fooleries. Who knows what mischief might not come of it in the future?\u0026rdquo; So he was wise in his generation, and would not have the door unbarred, except upon rare and formal occasion, which seemed to have neither warmth nor mirth in them to the two children, who had been accustomed so long to a daily gleeful, careless, happy interchange of greeting, speech, and pastime, with no other watcher of their sports or auditor of their fancies than Patrasche, sagely shaking the brazen bells of his collar and responding with all a dog\u0026rsquo;s swift sympathies to their every change of mood.\nAll this while the little panel of pine wood remained over the chimney in the mill-kitchen with the cuckoo clock and the waxen Calvary, and sometimes it seemed to Nello a little hard that whilst his gift was accepted he himself should be denied.\nBut he did not complain: it was his habit to be quiet: old Jehan Daas had said ever to him, \u0026ldquo;We are poor: we must take what God sends\u0026ndash;the ill with the good: the poor cannot choose.\u0026rdquo;\nTo which the boy had always listened in silence, being reverent of his old grandfather; but nevertheless a certain vague, sweet hope, such as beguiles the children of genius, had whispered in his heart, \u0026ldquo;Yet the poor do choose sometimes\u0026ndash;choose to be great, so that men cannot say them nay.\u0026rdquo; And he thought so still in his innocence; and one day, when the little Alois, finding him by chance alone among the cornfields by the canal, ran to him and held him close, and sobbed piteously because the morrow would be her saint\u0026rsquo;s day, and for the first time in all her life her parents had failed to bid him to the little supper and romp in the great barns with which her feast-day was always celebrated, Nello had kissed her and murmured to her in firm faith, \u0026ldquo;It shall be different one day, Alois. One day that little bit of pine wood that your father has of mine shall be worth its weight in silver; and he will not shut the door against me then. Only love me always, dear little Alois, only love me always, and I will be great.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And if I do not love you?\u0026rdquo; the pretty child asked, pouting a little through her tears, and moved by the instinctive coquetries of her sex.\nNello\u0026rsquo;s eyes left her face and wandered to the distance, where in the red and gold of the Flemish night the cathedral spire rose. There was a smile on his face so sweet and yet so sad that little Alois was awed by it. \u0026ldquo;I will be great still,\u0026rdquo; he said under his breath\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;great still, or die, Alois.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You do not love me,\u0026rdquo; said the little spoilt child, pushing him away; but the boy shook his head and smiled, and went on his way through the tall yellow corn, seeing as in a vision some day in a fair future when he should come into that old familiar land and ask Alois of her people, and be not refused or denied, but received in honor, whilst the village folk should throng to look upon him and say in one another\u0026rsquo;s ears, \u0026ldquo;Dost see him? He is a king among men, for he is a great artist and the world speaks his name; and yet he was only our poor little Nello, who was a beggar as one may say, and only got his bread by the help of his dog.\u0026rdquo; And he thought how he would fold his grandsire in furs and purples, and portray him as the old man is portrayed in the Family in the chapel of St. Jacques; and of how he would hang the throat of Patrasche with a collar of gold, and place him on his right hand, and say to the people, \u0026ldquo;This was once my only friend;\u0026rdquo; and of how he would build himself a great white marble palace, and make to himself luxuriant gardens of pleasure, on the slope looking outward to where the cathedral spire rose, and not dwell in it himself, but summon to it, as to a home, all men young and poor and friendless, but of the will to do mighty things; and of how he would say to them always, if they sought to bless his name, \u0026ldquo;Nay, do not thank me\u0026ndash;thank Rubens. Without him, what should I have been?\u0026rdquo; And these dreams, beautiful, impossible, innocent, free of all selfishness, full of heroical worship, were so closely about him as he went that he was happy\u0026ndash;happy even on this sad anniversary of Alois\u0026rsquo;s saint\u0026rsquo;s day, when he and Patrasche went home by themselves to the little dark hut and the meal of black bread, whilst in the mill-house all the children of the village sang and laughed, and ate the big round cakes of Dijon and the almond gingerbread of Brabant, and danced in the great barn to the light of the stars and the music of flute and fiddle.\n\u0026ldquo;Never mind, Patrasche,\u0026rdquo; he said, with his arms round the dog\u0026rsquo;s neck as they both sat in the door of the hut, where the sounds of the mirth at the mill came down to them on the night air\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;never mind. It shall all be changed by and by.\u0026rdquo;\nHe believed in the future: Patrasche, of more experience and of more philosophy, thought that the loss of the mill supper in the present was ill compensated by dreams of milk and honey in some vague hereafter. And Patrasche growled whenever he passed by Baas Cogez.\n\u0026ldquo;This is Alois\u0026rsquo;s name-day, is it not?\u0026rdquo; said the old man Daas that night from the corner where he was stretched upon his bed of sacking.\nThe boy gave a gesture of assent: he wished that the old man\u0026rsquo;s memory had erred a little, instead of keeping such sure account.\n\u0026ldquo;And why not there?\u0026rdquo; his grandfather pursued. \u0026ldquo;Thou hast never missed a year before, Nello.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thou art too sick to leave,\u0026rdquo; murmured the lad, bending his handsome head over the bed.\n\u0026ldquo;Tut! tut! Mother Nulette would have come and sat with me, as she does scores of times. What is the cause, Nello?\u0026rdquo; the old man persisted. \u0026ldquo;Thou surely hast not had ill words with the little one?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nay, grandfather\u0026ndash;never,\u0026rdquo; said the boy quickly, with a hot color in his bent face. \u0026ldquo;Simply and truly, Baas Cogez did not have me asked this year. He has taken some whim against me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But thou hast done nothing wrong?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That I know\u0026ndash;nothing. I took the portrait of Alois on a piece of pine: that is all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah!\u0026rdquo; The old man was silent: the truth suggested itself to him with the boy\u0026rsquo;s innocent answer. He was tied to a bed of dried leaves in the corner of a wattle hut, but he had not wholly forgotten what the ways of the world were like.\nHe drew Nello\u0026rsquo;s fair head fondly to his breast with a tenderer gesture. \u0026ldquo;Thou art very poor, my child,\u0026rdquo; he said with a quiver the more in his aged, trembling voice\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;so poor! It is very hard for thee.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nay, I am rich,\u0026rdquo; murmured Nello; and in his innocence he thought so\u0026ndash;rich with the imperishable powers that are mightier than the might of kings. And he went and stood by the door of the hut in the quiet autumn night, and watched the stars troop by and the tall poplars bend and shiver in the wind. All the casements of the mill-house were lighted, and every now and then the notes of the flute came to him. The tears fell down his cheeks, for he was but a child, yet he smiled, for he said to himself, \u0026ldquo;In the future!\u0026rdquo; He stayed there until all was quite still and dark, then he and Patrasche went within and slept together, long and deeply, side by side.\nNow he had a secret which only Patrasche knew. There was a little out-house to the hut, which no one entered but himself\u0026ndash;a dreary place, but with abundant clear light from the north. Here he had fashioned himself rudely an easel in rough lumber, and here on a great gray sea of stretched paper he had given shape to one of the innumerable fancies which possessed his brain. No one had ever taught him anything; colors he had no means to buy; he had gone without bread many a time to procure even the few rude vehicles that he had here; and it was only in black or white that he could fashion the things he saw. This great figure which he had drawn here in chalk was only an old man sitting on a fallen tree\u0026ndash;only that.\nHe had seen old Michel the woodman sitting so at evening many a time. He had never had a soul to tell him of outline or perspective, of anatomy or of shadow, and yet he had given all the weary, worn-out age, all the sad, quiet patience, all the rugged, careworn pathos of his original, and given them so that the old lonely figure was a poem, sitting there, meditative and alone, on the dead tree, with the darkness of the descending night behind him.\nIt was rude, of course, in a way, and had many faults, no doubt; and yet it was real, true in nature, true in art, and very mournful, and in a manner beautiful.\nPatrasche had lain quiet countless hours watching its gradual creation after the labor of each day was done, and he knew that Nello had a hope\u0026ndash;vain and wild perhaps, but strongly cherished\u0026ndash;of sending this great drawing to compete for a prize of two hundred francs a year which it was announced in Antwerp would be open to every lad of talent, scholar or peasant, under eighteen, who would attempt to win it with some unaided work of chalk or pencil. Three of the foremost artists in the town of Rubens were to be the judges and elect the victor according to his merits.\nAll the spring and summer and autumn Nello had been at work upon this treasure, which, if triumphant, would build him his first step toward independence and the mysteries of the art which he blindly, ignorantly, and yet passionately adored.\nHe said nothing to any one: his grandfather would not have understood, and little Alois was lost to him. Only to Patrasche he told all, and whispered, \u0026ldquo;Rubens would give it me, I think, if he knew.\u0026rdquo;\nPatrasche thought so too, for he knew that Rubens had loved dogs or he had never painted them with such exquisite fidelity; and men who loved dogs were, as Patrasche knew, always pitiful.\nThe drawings were to go in on the first day of December, and the decision be given on the twenty-fourth, so that he who should win might rejoice with all his people at the Christmas season.\nIn the twilight of a bitter wintry day, and with a beating heart, now quick with hope, now faint with fear, Nello placed the great picture on his little green milk-cart, and took it, with the help of Patrasche, into the town, and there left it, as enjoined, at the doors of a public building.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps it is worth nothing at all. How can I tell?\u0026rdquo; he thought, with the heart-sickness of a great timidity. Now that he had left it there, it seemed to him so hazardous, so vain, so foolish, to dream that he, a little lad with bare feet, who barely knew his letters, could do anything at which great painters, real artists, could ever deign to look. Yet he took heart as he went by the cathedral: the lordly form of Rubens seemed to rise from the fog and the darkness, and to loom in its magnificence before him, whilst the lips, with their kindly smile, seemed to him to murmur, \u0026ldquo;Nay, have courage! It was not by a weak heart and by faint fears that I wrote my name for all time upon Antwerp.\u0026rdquo;\nNello ran home through the cold night, comforted. He had done his best: the rest must be as God willed, he thought, in that innocent, unquestioning faith which had been taught him in the little gray chapel among the willows and the poplar-trees.\nThe winter was very sharp already. That night, after they reached the hut, snow fell; and fell for very many days after that, so that the paths and the divisions in the fields were all obliterated, and all the smaller streams were frozen over, and the cold was intense upon the plains. Then, indeed, it became hard work to go round for the milk while the world was all dark, and carry it through the darkness to the silent town. Hard work, especially for Patrasche, for the passage of the years, that were only bringing Nello a stronger youth, were bringing him old age, and his joints were stiff and his bones ached often. But he would never give up his share of the labor. Nello would fain have spared him and drawn the cart himself, but Patrasche would not allow it. All he would ever permit or accept was the help of a thrust from behind to the truck as it lumbered along through the ice-ruts. Patrasche had lived in harness, and he was proud of it. He suffered a great deal sometimes from frost, and the terrible roads, and the rheumatic pains of his limbs, but he only drew his breath hard and bent his stout neck, and trod onward with steady patience.\n\u0026ldquo;Rest thee at home, Patrasche\u0026ndash;it is time thou didst rest\u0026ndash;and I can quite well push in the cart by myself,\u0026rdquo; urged Nello many a morning; but Patrasche, who understood him aright, would no more have consented to stay at home than a veteran soldier to shirk when the charge was sounding; and every day he would rise and place himself in his shafts, and plod along over the snow through the fields that his four round feet had left their print upon so many, many years.\n\u0026ldquo;One must never rest till one dies,\u0026rdquo; thought Patrasche; and sometimes it seemed to him that that time of rest for him was not very far off. His sight was less clear than it had been, and it gave him pain to rise after the night\u0026rsquo;s sleep, though he would never lie a moment in his straw when once the bell of the chapel tolling five let him know that the daybreak of labor had begun.\n\u0026ldquo;My poor Patrasche, we shall soon lie quiet together, you and I,\u0026rdquo; said old Jehan Daas, stretching out to stroke the head of Patrasche with the old withered hand which had always shared with him its one poor crust of bread; and the hearts of the old man and the old dog ached together with one thought: When they were gone, who would care for their darling?\nOne afternoon, as they came back from Antwerp over the snow, which had become hard and smooth as marble over all the Flemish plains, they found dropped in the road a pretty little puppet, a tambourine\u0026ndash;player, all scarlet and gold, about six inches high, and, unlike greater personages when Fortune lets them drop, quite unspoiled and unhurt by its fall. It was a pretty toy. Nello tried to find its owner, and, failing, thought that it was just the thing to please Alois.\nIt was quite night when he passed the mill-house: he knew the little window of her room. It could be no harm, he thought, if he gave her his little piece of treasure-trove, they had been playfellows so long. There was a shed with a sloping roof beneath her casement: he climbed it and tapped softly at the lattice: there was a little light within. The child opened it and looked out half frightened. Nello put the tambourine-player into her hands. \u0026ldquo;Here is a doll I found in the snow, Alois. Take it,\u0026rdquo; he whispered\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;take it, and God bless thee, dear!\u0026rdquo;\nHe slid down from the shed-roof before she had time to thank him, and ran off through the darkness.\nThat night there was a fire at the mill. Outbuildings and much corn were destroyed, although the mill itself and the dwelling-house were unharmed. All the village was out in terror, and engines came tearing through the snow from Antwerp. The miller was insured, and would lose nothing: nevertheless, he was in furious wrath, and declared aloud that the fire was due to no accident, but to some foul intent.\nNello, awakened from his sleep, ran to help with the rest: Baas Cogez thrust him angrily aside. \u0026ldquo;Thou wert loitering here after dark,\u0026rdquo; he said roughly. \u0026ldquo;I believe, on my soul, that thou dost know more of the fire than any one.\u0026rdquo;\nNello heard him in silence, stupefied, not supposing that any one could say such things except in jest, and not comprehending how any one could pass a jest at such a time.\nNevertheless, the miller said the brutal thing openly to many of his neighbors in the day that followed; and though no serious charge was ever preferred against the lad, it got bruited about that Nello had been seen in the mill-yard after dark on some unspoken errand, and that he bore Baas Cogez a grudge for forbidding his intercourse with little Alois; and so the hamlet, which followed the sayings of its richest landowner servilely, and whose families all hoped to secure the riches of Alois in some future time for their sons, took the hint to give grave looks and cold words to old Jehan Daas\u0026rsquo;s grandson. No one said anything to him openly, but all the village agreed together to humor the miller\u0026rsquo;s prejudice, and at the cottages and farms where Nello and Patrasche called every morning for the milk for Antwerp, downcast glances and brief phrases replaced to them the broad smiles and cheerful greetings to which they had been always used. No one really credited the miller\u0026rsquo;s absurd suspicion, nor the outrageous accusations born of them, but the people were all very poor and very ignorant, and the one rich man of the place had pronounced against him. Nello, in his innocence and his friendlessness, had no strength to stem the popular tide.\n\u0026ldquo;Thou art very cruel to the lad,\u0026rdquo; the miller\u0026rsquo;s wife dared to say, weeping, to her lord. \u0026ldquo;Sure he is an innocent lad and a faithful, and would never dream of any such wickedness, however sore his heart might be.\u0026rdquo;\nBut Baas Cogez being an obstinate man, having once said a thing held to it doggedly, though in his innermost soul he knew well the injustice that he was committing.\nMeanwhile, Nello endured the injury done against him with a certain proud patience that disdained to complain: he only gave way a little when he was quite alone with old Patrasche. Besides, he thought, \u0026ldquo;If it should win! They will be sorry then, perhaps.\u0026rdquo;\nStill, to a boy not quite sixteen, and who had dwelt in one little world all his short life, and in his childhood had been caressed and applauded on all sides, it was a hard trial to have the whole of that little world turn against him for naught. Especially hard in that bleak, snow-bound, famine-stricken winter-time, when the only light and warmth there could be found abode beside the village hearths and in the kindly greetings of neighbors. In the winter-time all drew nearer to each other, all to all, except to Nello and Patrasche, with whom none now would have anything to do, and who were left to fare as they might with the old paralyzed, bedridden man in the little cabin, whose fire was often low, and whose board was often without bread, for there was a buyer from Antwerp who had taken to drive his mule in of a day for the milk of the various dairies, and there were only three or four of the people who had refused his terms of purchase and remained faithful to the little green cart. So that the burden which Patrasche drew had become very light, and the centime-pieces in Nello\u0026rsquo;s pouch had become, alas! very small likewise.\nThe dog would stop, as usual, at all the familiar gates, which were now closed to him, and look up at them with wistful, mute appeal; and it cost the neighbors a pang to shut their doors and their hearts, and let Patrasche draw his cart on again, empty. Nevertheless, they did it, for they desired to please Baas Cogez.\nNoël was close at hand.\nThe weather was very wild and cold. The snow was six feet deep, and the ice was firm enough to bear oxen and men upon it everywhere. At this season the little village was always gay and cheerful. At the poorest dwelling there were possets and cakes, joking and dancing, sugared saints and gilded Jésus. The merry Flemish bells jingled everywhere on the horses; everywhere within doors some well-filled soup-pot sang and smoked over the stove; and everywhere over the snow without laughing maidens pattered in bright kerchiefs and stout kirtles, going to and from the mass. Only in the little hut it was very dark and very cold.\nNello and Patrasche were left utterly alone, for one night in the week before the Christmas Day, Death entered there, and took away from life forever old Jehan Daas, who had never known life aught save its poverty and its pains. He had long been half dead, incapable of any movement except a feeble gesture, and powerless for anything beyond a gentle word; and yet his loss fell on them both with a great horror in it: they mourned him passionately. He had passed away from them in his sleep, and when in the gray dawn they learned their bereavement, unutterable solitude and desolation seemed to close around them. He had long been only a poor, feeble, paralyzed old man, who could not raise a hand in their defence, but he had loved them well: his smile had always welcomed their return. They mourned for him unceasingly, refusing to be comforted, as in the white winter day they followed the deal shell that held his body to the nameless grave by the little gray church. They were his only mourners, these two whom he had left friendless upon earth\u0026ndash;the young boy and the old dog.\n\u0026ldquo;Surely, he will relent now and let the poor lad come hither?\u0026rdquo; thought the miller\u0026rsquo;s wife, glancing at her husband smoking by the hearth.\nBaas Cogez knew her thought, but he hardened his heart, and would not unbar his door as the little, humble funeral went by. \u0026ldquo;The boy is a beggar,\u0026rdquo; he said to himself: \u0026ldquo;he shall not be about Alois.\u0026rdquo;\nThe woman dared not say anything aloud, but when the grave was closed and the mourners had gone, she put a wreath of immortelles into Alois\u0026rsquo;s hands and bade her go and lay it reverently on the dark, unmarked mound where the snow was displaced.\nNello and Patrasche went home with broken hearts. But even of that poor, melancholy, cheerless home they were denied the consolation. There was a month\u0026rsquo;s rent over-due for their little home, and when Nello had paid the last sad service to the dead he had not a coin left. He went and begged grace of the owner of the hut, a cobbler who went every Sunday night to drink his pint of wine and smoke with Baas Cogez. The cobbler would grant no mercy. He was a harsh, miserly man, and loved money. He claimed in default of his rent every stick and stone, every pot and pan, in the hut, and bade Nello and Patrasche be out of it on the morrow.\nNow, the cabin was lowly enough, and in some sense miserable enough, and yet their hearts clove to it with a great affection. They had been so happy there, and in the summer, with its clambering vine and its flowering beans, it was so pretty and bright in the midst of the sunlighted fields! There life in it had been full of labor and privation, and yet they had been so well content, so gay of heart, running together to meet the old man\u0026rsquo;s never-failing smile of welcome!\nAll night long the boy and the dog sat by the fireless hearth in the darkness, drawn close together for warmth and sorrow. Their bodies were insensible to the cold, but their hearts seemed frozen in them.\nWhen the morning broke over the white, chill earth it was the morning of Christmas Eve. With a shudder, Nello clasped close to him his only friend, while his tears fell hot and fast on the dog\u0026rsquo;s frank forehead. \u0026ldquo;Let us go, Patrasche\u0026ndash;dear, dear Patrasche,\u0026rdquo; he murmured. \u0026ldquo;We will not wait to be kicked out: let us go.\u0026rdquo;\nPatrasche had no will but his, and they went sadly, side by side, out from the little place which was so dear to them both, and in which every humble, homely thing was to them precious and beloved. Patrasche drooped his head wearily as he passed by his own green cart: it was no longer his\u0026ndash;it had to go with the rest to pay the rent, and his brass harness lay idle and glittering on the snow. The dog could have lain down beside it and died for very heart-sickness as he went, but whilst the lad lived and needed him Patrasche would not yield and give way.\nThey took the old accustomed road into Antwerp. The day had yet scarce more than dawned, most of the shutters were still closed, but some of the villagers were about. They took no notice whilst the dog and the boy passed by them. At one door Nello paused and looked wistfully within: his grandfather had done many a kindly turn in neighbor\u0026rsquo;s service to the people who dwelt there.\n\u0026ldquo;Would you give Patrasche a crust?\u0026rdquo; he said, timidly. \u0026ldquo;He is old, and he has had nothing since last forenoon.\u0026rdquo;\nThe woman shut the door hastily, murmuring some vague saying about wheat and rye being very dear that season. The boy and the dog went on again wearily: they asked no more.\nBy slow and painful ways they reached Antwerp as the chimes tolled ten.\n\u0026ldquo;If I had anything about me I could sell to get him bread!\u0026rdquo; thought Nello, but he had nothing except the wisp of linen and serge that covered him, and his pair of wooden shoes. Patrasche understood, and nestled his nose into the lad\u0026rsquo;s hand, as though to pray him not to be disquieted for any woe or want of his.\nThe winner of the drawing-prize was to be proclaimed at noon, and to the public building where he had left his treasure Nello made his way. On the steps and in the entrance-hall there was a crowd of youths\u0026ndash;some of his age, some older, all with parents or relatives or friends. His heart was sick with fear as he went among them, holding Patrasche close to him. The great bells of the city clashed out the hour of noon with brazen clamor. The doors of the inner hall were opened; the eager, panting throng rushed in: it was known that the selected picture would be raised above the rest upon a wooden dais..\nA mist obscured Nello\u0026rsquo;s sight, his head swam, his limbs almost failed him. When his vision cleared he saw the drawing raised on high: it was not his own! A slow, sonorous voice was proclaiming aloud that victory had been adjudged to Stephen Kiesslinger, born in the burgh of Antwerp, son of a wharfinger in that town.\nWhen Nello recovered his consciousness he was lying on the stones without, and Patrasche was trying with every art he knew to call him back to life. In the distance a throng of the youths of Antwerp were shouting around their successful comrade, and escorting him with acclamations to his home upon the quay.\nThe boy staggered to his feet and drew the dog into his embrace. \u0026ldquo;It is all over, dear Patrasche,\u0026rdquo; he murmured\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;all over!\u0026rdquo;\nHe rallied himself as best he could, for he was weak from fasting, and retraced his steps to the village. Patrasche paced by his side with his head drooping and his old limbs feeble from hunger and sorrow.\nThe snow was falling fast: a keen hurricane blew from the north: it was bitter as death on the plains. It took them long to traverse the familiar path, and the bells were sounding four of the clock as they approached the hamlet. Suddenly Patrasche paused, arrested by a scent in the snow, scratched, whined, and drew out with his teeth a small case of brown leather. He held it up to Nello in the darkness. Where they were there stood a little Calvary, and a lamp burned dully under the cross: the boy mechanically turned the case to the light: on it was the name of Baas Cogez, and within it were notes for two thousand francs.\nThe sight roused the lad a little from his stupor. He thrust it in his shirt, and stroked Patrasche and drew him onward. The dog looked up wistfully in his face.\nNello made straight for the mill-house, and went to the house-door and struck on its panels. The miller\u0026rsquo;s wife opened it weeping, with little Alois clinging close to her skirts. \u0026ldquo;Is it thee, thou poor lad?\u0026rdquo; she said kindly through her tears. \u0026ldquo;Get thee gone ere the Baas see thee. We are in sore trouble to-night. He is out seeking for a power of money that he has let fall riding homeward, and in this snow he never will find it; and God knows it will go nigh to ruin us. It is Heaven\u0026rsquo;s own judgment for the things we have done to thee.\u0026rdquo;\nNello put the note-case in her hand and called Patrasche within the house. \u0026ldquo;Patrasche found the money to-night,\u0026rdquo; he said quickly. \u0026ldquo;Tell Baas Cogez so: I think he will not deny the dog shelter and food in his old age. Keep him from pursuing me, and I pray of you to be good to him.\u0026rdquo;\nEre either woman or dog knew what he meant he had stooped and kissed Patrasche: then closed the door hurriedly, and disappeared in the gloom of the fast\u0026ndash;falling night.\nThe woman and the child stood speechless with joy and fear: Patrasche vainly spent the fury of his anguish against the iron-bound oak of the barred house-door. They did not dare unbar the door and let him forth: they tried all they could to solace him. They brought him sweet cakes and juicy meats; they tempted him with the best they had; they tried to lure him to abide by the warmth of the hearth; but it was of no avail. Patrasche refused to be comforted or to stir from the barred portal.\nIt was six o\u0026rsquo;clock when from an opposite entrance the miller at last came, jaded and broken, into his wife\u0026rsquo;s presence. \u0026ldquo;It is lost forever,\u0026rdquo; he said, with an ashen cheek and a quiver in his stern voice. \u0026ldquo;We have looked with lanterns everywhere: it is gone\u0026ndash;the little maiden\u0026rsquo;s portion and all!\u0026rdquo;\nHis wife put the money into his hand, and told him how it had come to her. The strong man sank trembling into a seat and covered his face, ashamed and almost afraid. \u0026ldquo;I have been cruel to the lad,\u0026rdquo; he muttered at length: \u0026ldquo;I deserved not to have good at his hands.\u0026rdquo;\nLittle Alois, taking courage, crept close to her father and nestled against him her fair curly head. \u0026ldquo;Nello may come here again, father?\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;He may come to-morrow as he used to do?\u0026rdquo;\nThe miller pressed her in his arms: his hard, sunburned face was very pale and his mouth trembled. \u0026ldquo;Surely, surely,\u0026rdquo; he answered his child. \u0026ldquo;He shall bide here on Christmas Day, and any other day he will. God helping me, I will make amends to the boy\u0026ndash;I will make amends.\u0026rdquo;\nLittle Alois kissed him in gratitude and joy, then slid from his knees and ran to where the dog kept watch by the door. \u0026ldquo;And to-night I may feast Patrasche?\u0026rdquo; she cried in a child\u0026rsquo;s thoughtless glee.\nHer father bent his head gravely: \u0026ldquo;Ay, ay: let the dog have the best;\u0026rdquo; for the stern old man was moved and shaken to his heart\u0026rsquo;s depths.\nIt was Christmas Eve, and the mill-house was filled with oak logs and squares of turf, with cream and honey, with meat and bread, and the rafters were hung with wreaths of evergreen, and the Calvary and the cuckoo clock looked out from a mass of holly. There were little paper lanterns, too, for Alois, and toys of various fashions and sweetmeats in bright-pictured papers. There were light and warmth and abundance everywhere, and the child would fain have made the dog a guest honored and feasted.\nBut Patrasche would neither lie in the warmth nor share in the cheer. Famished he was and very cold, but without Nello he would partake neither of comfort nor food. Against all temptation he was proof, and close against the door he leaned always, watching only for a means of escape.\n\u0026ldquo;He wants the lad,\u0026rdquo; said Baas Cogez. \u0026ldquo;Good dog! good dog! I will go over to the lad the first thing at day-dawn.\u0026rdquo; For no one but Patrasche knew that Nello had left the hut, and no one but Patrasche divined that Nello had gone to face starvation and misery alone.\nThe mill-kitchen was very warm: great logs crackled and flamed on the hearth; neighbors came in for a glass of wine and a slice of the fat goose baking for supper. Alois, gleeful and sure of her playmate back on the morrow, bounded and sang and tossed back her yellow hair. Baas Cogez, in the fulness of his heart, smiled on her through moistened eyes, and spoke of the way in which he would befriend her favorite companion; the house-mother sat with calm, contented face at the spinning-wheel; the cuckoo in the clock chirped mirthful hours. Amidst it all Patrasche was bidden with a thousand words of welcome to tarry there a cherished guest. But neither peace nor plenty could allure him where Nello was not.\nWhen the supper smoked on the board, and the voices were loudest and gladdest, and the Christ-child brought choicest gifts to Alois, Patrasche, watching always an occasion, glided out when the door was unlatched by a careless new-comer, and as swiftly as his weak and tired limbs would bear him sped over the snow in the bitter, black night. He had only one thought\u0026ndash;to follow Nello. A human friend might have paused for the pleasant meal, the cheery warmth, the cosey slumber; but that was not the friendship of Patrasche. He remembered a bygone time, when an old man and a little child had found him sick unto death in the wayside ditch.\nSnow had fallen freshly all the evening long; it was now nearly ten; the trail of the boy\u0026rsquo;s footsteps was almost obliterated. It took Patrasche long to discover any scent. When at last he found it, it was lost again quickly, and lost and recovered, and again lost and again recovered, a hundred times or more.\nThe night was very wild. The lamps under the wayside crosses were blown out; the roads were sheets of ice; the impenetrable darkness hid every trace of habitations; there was no living thing abroad. All the cattle were housed, and in all the huts and homesteads men and women rejoiced and feasted. There was only Patrasche out in the cruel cold\u0026ndash;old and famished and full of pain, but with the strength and the patience of a great love to sustain him in his search.\nThe trail of Nello\u0026rsquo;s steps, faint and obscure as it was under the new snow, went straightly along the accustomed tracks into Antwerp. It was past midnight when Patrasche traced it over the boundaries of the town and into the narrow, tortuous, gloomy streets. It was all quite dark in the town, save where some light gleamed ruddily through the crevices of house-shutters, or some group went homeward with lanterns chanting drinking-songs. The streets were all white with ice: the high walls and roofs loomed black against them. There was scarce a sound save the riot of the winds down the passages as they tossed the creaking signs and shook the tall lamp-irons.\nSo many passers-by had trodden through and through the snow, so many diverse paths had crossed and recrossed each other, that the dog had a hard task to retain any hold on the track he followed. But he kept on his way, though the cold pierced him to the bone, and the jagged ice cut his feet, and the hunger in his body gnawed like a rat\u0026rsquo;s teeth. He kept on his way, a poor gaunt, shivering thing, and by long patience traced the steps he loved into the very heart of the burgh and up to the steps of the great cathedral.\n\u0026ldquo;He is gone to the things that he loved,\u0026rdquo; thought Patrasche: he could not understand, but he was full of sorrow and of pity for the art-passion that to him was so incomprehensible and yet so sacred.\nThe portals of the cathedral were unclosed after the midnight mass. Some heedlessness in the custodians, too eager to go home and feast or sleep, or too drowsy to know whether they turned the keys aright, had left one of the doors unlocked. By that accident the foot-falls Patrasche sought had passed through into the building, leaving the white marks of snow upon the dark stone floor. By that slender white thread, frozen as it fell, he was guided through the intense silence, through the immensity of the vaulted space\u0026ndash;guided straight to the gates of the chancel, and, stretched there upon the stones, he found Nello. He crept up and touched the face of the boy. \u0026ldquo;Didst thou dream that I should be faithless and forsake thee? I\u0026ndash;a dog?\u0026rdquo; said that mute caress.\nThe lad raised himself with a low cry and clasped him close. \u0026ldquo;Let us lie down and die together,\u0026rdquo; he murmured. \u0026ldquo;Men have no need of us, and we are all alone.\u0026rdquo;\nIn answer, Patrasche crept closer yet, and laid his head upon the young boy\u0026rsquo;s breast. The great tears stood in his brown, sad eyes: not for himself\u0026ndash;for himself he was happy.\nThey lay close together in the piercing cold. The blasts that blew over the Flemish dikes from the northern seas were like waves of ice, which froze every living thing they touched. The interior of the immense vault of stone in which they were was even more bitterly chill than the snow-covered plains without. Now and then a bat moved in the shadows\u0026ndash;now and then a gleam of light came on the ranks of carven figures. Under the Rubens they lay together quite still, and soothed almost into a dreaming slumber by the numbing narcotic of the cold. Together they dreamed of the old glad days when they had chased each other through the flowering grasses of the summer meadows, or sat hidden in the tall bulrushes by the water\u0026rsquo;s side, watching the boats go seaward in the sun.\nSuddenly through the darkness a great white radiance streamed through the vastness of the aisles; the moon, that was at her height, had broken through the clouds, the snow had ceased to fall, the light reflected from the snow without was clear as the light of dawn. It fell through the arches full upon the two pictures above, from which the boy on his entrance had flung back the veil: the Elevation and the Descent of the Cross were for one instant visible.\nNello rose to his feet and stretched his arms to them; the tears of a passionate ecstasy glistened on the paleness of his face. \u0026ldquo;I have seen them at last!\u0026rdquo; he cried aloud. \u0026ldquo;O God, it is enough!\u0026rdquo;\nHis limbs failed under him, and he sank upon his knees, still gazing upward at the majesty that he adored. For a few brief moments the light illumined the divine visions that had been denied to him so long\u0026ndash;light clear and sweet and strong as though it streamed from the throne of Heaven. Then suddenly it passed away: once more a great darkness covered the face of Christ.\nThe arms of the boy drew close again the body of the dog. \u0026ldquo;We shall see His face\u0026ndash;there,\u0026rdquo; he murmured; \u0026ldquo;and He will not part us, I think.\u0026rdquo; On the morrow, by the chancel of the cathedral, the people of Antwerp found them both. They were both dead: the cold of the night had frozen into stillness alike the young life and the old. When the Christmas morning broke and the priests came to the temple, they saw them lying thus on the stones together. Above the veils were drawn back from the great visions of Rubens, and the fresh rays of the sunrise touched the thorn-crowned head of the Christ.\nAs the day grew on there came an old, hard-featured man who wept as women weep. \u0026ldquo;I was cruel to the lad,\u0026rdquo; he muttered, \u0026ldquo;and now I would have made amends\u0026ndash;yea, to the half of my substance\u0026ndash;and he should have been to me as a son.\u0026rdquo;\nThere came also, as the day grew apace, a painter who had fame in the world, and who was liberal of hand and of spirit. \u0026ldquo;I seek one who should have had the prize yesterday had worth won,\u0026rdquo; he said to the people\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;a boy of rare promise and genius. An old wood-cutter on a fallen tree at eventide\u0026ndash;that was all his theme. But there was greatness for the future in it. I would fain find him, and take him with me and teach him Art.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd a little child with curling fair hair, sobbing bitterly as she clung to her father\u0026rsquo;s arm, cried aloud, \u0026ldquo;Oh, Nello, come! We have all ready for thee. The Christ-child\u0026rsquo;s hands are full of gifts, and the old piper will play for us; and the mother says thou shalt stay by the hearth and burn nuts with us all the Noël week long\u0026ndash;yes, even to the Feast of the Kings! And Patrasche will be so happy! Oh, Nello, wake and come!\u0026rdquo;\nBut the young pale face, turned upward to the light of the great Rubens with a smile upon its mouth, answered them all, \u0026ldquo;It is too late.\u0026rdquo;\nFor the sweet, sonorous bells went ringing through the frost, and the sunlight shone upon the plains of snow, and the populace trooped gay and glad through the streets, but Nello and Patrasche no more asked charity at their hands. All they needed now Antwerp gave unbidden.\nDeath had been more pitiful to them than longer life would have been. It had taken the one in the loyalty of love, and the other in the innocence of faith, from a world which for love has no recompense and for faith no fulfilment.\nAll their lives they had been together, and in their deaths they were not divided: for when they were found the arms of the boy were folded too closely around the dog to be severed without violence, and the people of their little village, contrite and ashamed, implored a special grace for them, and, making them one grave, laid them to rest there side by side\u0026ndash;forever!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/docs/a-dog-of-flanders/","section":"Documentation","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eNELLO, AWAKENED FROM HIS SLEEP, RAN TO HELP WITH THE REST THEN LITTLE NELLO TOOK HIS PLACE BESIDE THE CART NELLO DREW THEIR LIKENESS WITH A STICK OF CHARCOAL THE PORTALS OF THE CATHEDRAL WERE UNCLOSED AFTER THE MIDNIGHT MASS A DOG OF FLANDERS A STORY OF NÖEL\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Dog of Flanders","type":"docs"},{"content":"Bird?

An adventurous pilot and a lyrical poet, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry conveyed in his books the solitude and mystic grandeur of the early days of flight. He described dangerous adventures in the skies and also wrote the whimsical children\u0026rsquo;s fable \u0026lsquo;The Little Prince\u0026rsquo;.\nAntoine-Marie-Roger de Saint-Exupéry was born on June 29, 1900, in Lyon, France. In the 1920s he helped establish airmail routes overseas. During World War II he flew as a military reconnaissance pilot.\nAfter the Germans occupied France in 1940, he escaped to the United States. He rejoined the air force in North Africa in 1943. During what was to have been his final reconnaissance mission over the Mediterranean Sea, he died when his plane was shot down on July 31, 1944. Saint-Exupery\u0026rsquo;s first book, \u0026lsquo;Southern Mail\u0026rsquo;, was about the life and death of an airmail pilot.\nIt was published in French in 1929. Other books include \u0026lsquo;Night Flight\u0026rsquo; (1931), about the first airline pilots, and \u0026lsquo;Wind, Sand, and Stars\u0026rsquo; (1939), in which he describes his feelings during flights over the desert.\n\u0026lsquo;The Little Prince\u0026rsquo; (1943), which in a way is really a children\u0026rsquo;s book for grown-ups, was written during Saint-Exupery\u0026rsquo;s stay in the United States. A gentle and thoughtful book, it tells the story of a boy who lives alone on a tiny planet.\nA final volume of reflections, which provides an insight into the author\u0026rsquo;s views on the meaning of life, is \u0026lsquo;The Wisdom of the Sands\u0026rsquo; (1948).

I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children\u0026ndash; although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:\nTo Leon Werth\nwhen he was a little boy\nChapter 1 # we are introduced to the narrator, a pilot, and his ideas about grown-ups\nOnce when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.\nIn the book it said: \u0026ldquo;Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.\u0026rdquo;\nI pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:\nI showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.\nBut they answered: \u0026ldquo;Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?\u0026rdquo;\nMy drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:\nThe grown-ups\u0026rsquo; response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.\nSo then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.\nIn the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn\u0026rsquo;t much improved my opinion of them.\nWhenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:\n\u0026ldquo;That is a hat.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.\nChapter 2 # the narrator crashes in the desert and makes the acquaintance of the little prince\nSo I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.\nThe first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:\n\u0026ldquo;If you please—draw me a sheep!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Draw me a sheep!\u0026rdquo;\nI jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.\nThat, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter\u0026rsquo;s career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.\nNow I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:\n\u0026ldquo;But—what are you doing here?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:\n\u0026ldquo;If you please—draw me a sheep\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nWhen a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Draw me a sheep\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBut I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,\n\u0026ldquo;No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep.\u0026rdquo;\nSo then I made a drawing.\nHe looked at it carefully, then he said:\n\u0026ldquo;No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I made another drawing.\nMy friend smiled gently and indulgently.\n\u0026ldquo;You see yourself,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns.\u0026rdquo;\nSo then I did my drawing over once more.\nBut it was rejected too, just like the others.\n\u0026ldquo;This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.\u0026rdquo;\nBy this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.\nAnd I threw out an explanation with it.\n\u0026ldquo;This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.\u0026rdquo;\nI was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:\n\u0026ldquo;That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because where I live everything is very small\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There will surely be enough grass for him,\u0026rdquo; I said. \u0026ldquo;It is a very small sheep that I have given you.\u0026rdquo;\nHe bent his head over the drawing.\n\u0026ldquo;Not so small that—Look! He has gone to sleep\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.\nChapter 3 # the narrator learns more about from where the little prince came\nIt took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.\nThe first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:\n\u0026ldquo;What is that object?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.\nHe cried out, then:\n\u0026ldquo;What! You dropped down from the sky?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; I answered, modestly.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh! That is funny!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.\nThen he added:\n\u0026ldquo;So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?\u0026rdquo;\nAt that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:\n\u0026ldquo;Do you come from another planet?\u0026rdquo;\nBut he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:\n\u0026ldquo;It is true that on that you can\u0026rsquo;t have come from very far away\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.\nYou can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the \u0026ldquo;other planets.\u0026rdquo; I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.\n\u0026ldquo;My little man, where do you come from? What is this ‘where I live,\u0026rsquo; of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a reflective silence he answered:\n\u0026ldquo;The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to.\u0026rdquo;\nBut the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:\n\u0026ldquo;Tie him! What a queer idea!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But if you don\u0026rsquo;t tie him,\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.\u0026rdquo;\nMy friend broke into another peal of laughter:\n\u0026ldquo;But where do you think he would go?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the little prince said, earnestly:\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:\n\u0026ldquo;Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nChapter 4 # the narrator speculates as to which asteroid from which the little prince came\nI had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!\nBut that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets—such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus—to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, \u0026ldquo;Asteroid 325.\u0026rdquo;\nI have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.\nThis asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.\nOn making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.\nGrown-ups are like that\u0026hellip;\nFortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.\nIf I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, \u0026ldquo;What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?\u0026rdquo; Instead, they demand: \u0026ldquo;How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?\u0026rdquo; Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\nIf you were to say to the grown-ups: \u0026ldquo;I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,\u0026rdquo; they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: \u0026ldquo;I saw a house that cost $20,000.\u0026rdquo; Then they would exclaim: \u0026ldquo;Oh, what a pretty house that is!\u0026rdquo;\nJust so, you might say to them: \u0026ldquo;The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.\u0026rdquo; And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: \u0026ldquo;The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,\u0026rdquo; then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.\nThey are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.\nBut certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: \u0026ldquo;Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nTo those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.\nFor I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures\u0026hellip;\nIt is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince\u0026rsquo;s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.\nIn certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.\nChapter 5 # we are warned as to the dangers of the baobabs\nAs each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince\u0026rsquo;s planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.\nThis time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly—as if seized by a grave doubt—\u0026ldquo;It is true, isn\u0026rsquo;t it, that sheep eat little bushes?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that is true.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! I am glad!\u0026rdquo;\nI did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:\n\u0026ldquo;Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?\u0026rdquo;\nI pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.\nThe idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.\n\u0026ldquo;We would have to put them one on top of the other,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nBut he made a wise comment:\n\u0026ldquo;Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is strictly correct,\u0026rdquo; I said. \u0026ldquo;But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?\u0026rdquo;\nHe answered me at once, \u0026ldquo;Oh, come, come!\u0026rdquo;, as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.\nIndeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived—as on all planets—good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth\u0026rsquo;s darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin—timidly at first—to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.\nNow there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;It is a question of discipline,\u0026rdquo; the little prince said to me later on. \u0026ldquo;When you\u0026rsquo;ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,\u0026rdquo; the little prince added, \u0026ldquo;but very easy.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd one day he said to me: \u0026ldquo;You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,\u0026rdquo; he added, \u0026ldquo;there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nSo, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. \u0026ldquo;Children,\u0026rdquo; I say plainly, \u0026ldquo;watch out for the baobabs!\u0026rdquo;\nMy friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.\nPerhaps you will ask me, \u0026ldquo;Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?\u0026rdquo;\nThe reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.\nChapter 6 # the little prince and the narrator talk about sunsets\nOh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life\u0026hellip; For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:\n\u0026ldquo;I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we must wait,\u0026rdquo; I said.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait? For what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For the sunset. We must wait until it is time.\u0026rdquo;\nAt first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:\n\u0026ldquo;I am always thinking that I am at home!\u0026rdquo;\nJust so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.\nIf you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;One day,\u0026rdquo; you said to me, \u0026ldquo;I saw the sunset forty-four times!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd a little later you added:\n\u0026ldquo;You know—one loves the sunset, when one is so sad\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Were you so sad, then?\u0026rdquo; I asked, \u0026ldquo;on the day of the forty-four sunsets?\u0026rdquo;\nBut the little prince made no reply.\nChapter 7 # the narrator learns about the secret of the little prince\u0026rsquo;s life\nOn the fifth day—again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep—the secret of the little prince\u0026rsquo;s life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:\n\u0026ldquo;A sheep—if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A sheep,\u0026rdquo; I answered, \u0026ldquo;eats anything it finds in its reach.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Even flowers that have thorns?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, even flowers that have thorns.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then the thorns—what use are they?\u0026rdquo;\nI did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.\n\u0026ldquo;The thorns—what use are they?\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:\n\u0026ldquo;The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh!\u0026rdquo;\nThere was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naïve. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: \u0026ldquo;If this bolt still won\u0026rsquo;t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.\u0026rdquo; Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:\n\u0026ldquo;And you actually believe that the flowers—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, no!\u0026rdquo; I cried. \u0026ldquo;No, no, no! I don\u0026rsquo;t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don\u0026rsquo;t you see—I am very busy with matters of consequence!\u0026rdquo;\nHe stared at me, thunderstruck.\n\u0026ldquo;Matters of consequence!\u0026rdquo;\nHe looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;You talk just like the grown-ups!\u0026rdquo;\nThat made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:\n\u0026ldquo;You mix everything up together\u0026hellip; You confuse everything\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.\n\u0026ldquo;I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: ‘I am busy with matters of consequence!\u0026rsquo; And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man—he is a mushroom!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A mushroom!\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince was now white with rage.\n\u0026ldquo;The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman\u0026rsquo;s sums? And if I know—I, myself—one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing—Oh! You think that is not important!\u0026rdquo;\nHis face turned from white to red as he continued:\n\u0026ldquo;If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, ‘Somewhere, my flower is there\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened\u0026hellip; And you think that is not important!\u0026rdquo;\nHe could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.\nThe night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:\n\u0026ldquo;The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will—\u0026rdquo;\nI did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.\nIt is such a secret place, the land of tears.\nChapter 8 # the rose arrives at the little prince\u0026rsquo;s planet\nI soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince\u0026rsquo;s planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.\nThe shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.\nThen one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.\nAnd, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBut the little prince could not restrain his admiration:\n\u0026ldquo;Oh! How beautiful you are!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Am I not?\u0026rdquo; the flower responded, sweetly. \u0026ldquo;And I was born at the same moment as the sun\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest—but how moving—and exciting—she was!\n\u0026ldquo;I think it is time for breakfast,\u0026rdquo; she added an instant later. \u0026ldquo;If you would have the kindness to think of my needs—\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.\nSo, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity—which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:\n\u0026ldquo;Let the tigers come with their claws!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There are no tigers on my planet,\u0026rdquo; the little prince objected. \u0026ldquo;And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am not a weed,\u0026rdquo; the flower replied, sweetly.\n\u0026ldquo;Please excuse me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am not at all afraid of tigers,\u0026rdquo; she went on, \u0026ldquo;but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a screen for me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A horror of drafts—that is bad luck, for a plant,\u0026rdquo; remarked the little prince, and added to himself, \u0026ldquo;This flower is a very complex creature\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from—\u0026rdquo;\nBut she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naïve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.\n\u0026ldquo;The screen?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThen she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.\nSo the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.\n\u0026ldquo;I ought not to have listened to her,\u0026rdquo; he confided to me one day. \u0026ldquo;One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he continued his confidences:\n\u0026ldquo;The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her\u0026hellip; I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nChapter 9 # the little prince leaves his planet\nI believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, \u0026ldquo;One never knows!\u0026rdquo; So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.\nOn our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.\nThe little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye,\u0026rdquo; he said to the flower.\nBut she made no answer.\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye,\u0026rdquo; he said again.\nThe flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.\n\u0026ldquo;I have been silly,\u0026rdquo; she said to him, at last. \u0026ldquo;I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course I love you,\u0026rdquo; the flower said to him. \u0026ldquo;It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you—you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy\u0026hellip; Let the glass globe be. I don\u0026rsquo;t want it any more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But the wind—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My cold is not so bad as all that\u0026hellip; The cool night air will do me good. I am a flower.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But the animals—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies—and the caterpillars—who will call upon me? You will be far away\u0026hellip; As for the large animals—I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, naïvely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!\u0026rdquo;\nFor she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower\u0026hellip;\nChapter 10 # the little prince visits the king\nHe found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.\nThe first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! Here is a subject,\u0026rdquo; exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.\nAnd the little prince asked himself:\n\u0026ldquo;How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?\u0026rdquo;\nHe did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.\n\u0026ldquo;Approach, so that I may see you better,\u0026rdquo; said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.\nThe little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king\u0026rsquo;s magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.\n\u0026ldquo;It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,\u0026rdquo; the monarch said to him. \u0026ldquo;I forbid you to do so.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t help it. I can\u0026rsquo;t stop myself,\u0026rdquo; replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. \u0026ldquo;I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, then,\u0026rdquo; the king said. \u0026ldquo;I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That frightens me\u0026hellip; I cannot, any more\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.\n\u0026ldquo;Hum! Hum!\u0026rdquo; replied the king. \u0026ldquo;Then I—I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to—\u0026rdquo;\nHe sputtered a little, and seemed vexed.\nFor what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.\n\u0026ldquo;If I ordered a general,\u0026rdquo; he would say, by way of example, \u0026ldquo;if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;May I sit down?\u0026rdquo; came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;I order you to do so,\u0026rdquo; the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.\nBut the little prince was wondering\u0026hellip; The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?\n\u0026ldquo;Sire,\u0026rdquo; he said to him, \u0026ldquo;I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I order you to ask me a question,\u0026rdquo; the king hastened to assure him.\n\u0026ldquo;Sire—over what do you rule?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Over everything,\u0026rdquo; said the king, with magnificent simplicity.\n\u0026ldquo;Over everything?\u0026rdquo;\nThe king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.\n\u0026ldquo;Over all that?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Over all that,\u0026rdquo; the king answered.\nFor his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.\n\u0026ldquo;And the stars obey you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Certainly they do,\u0026rdquo; the king said. \u0026ldquo;They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.\u0026rdquo;\nSuch power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:\n\u0026ldquo;I should like to see a sunset\u0026hellip; Do me that kindness\u0026hellip; Order the sun to set\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?\u0026rdquo; the king demanded. \u0026ldquo;The general, or myself?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince firmly.\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform,\u0026rdquo; the king went on. \u0026ldquo;Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then my sunset?\u0026rdquo; the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it.\n\u0026ldquo;You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When will that be?\u0026rdquo; inquired the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Hum! Hum!\u0026rdquo; replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. \u0026ldquo;Hum! Hum! That will be about—about—that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.\n\u0026ldquo;I have nothing more to do here,\u0026rdquo; he said to the king. \u0026ldquo;So I shall set out on my way again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do not go,\u0026rdquo; said the king, who was very proud of having a subject. \u0026ldquo;Do not go. I will make you a Minister!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Minister of what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Minster of—of Justice!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But there is nobody here to judge!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We do not know that,\u0026rdquo; the king said to him. \u0026ldquo;I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, but I have looked already!\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Then you shall judge yourself,\u0026rdquo; the king answered. \u0026ldquo;that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, \u0026ldquo;but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet.\n\u0026ldquo;Hum! Hum!\u0026rdquo; said the king. \u0026ldquo;I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I,\u0026rdquo; replied the little prince, \u0026ldquo;do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; said the king.\nBut the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.\n\u0026ldquo;If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAs the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.\n\u0026ldquo;I make you my Ambassador,\u0026rdquo; the king called out, hastily.\nHe had a magnificent air of authority.\n\u0026ldquo;The grown-ups are very strange,\u0026rdquo; the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.\nChapter 11 # the little prince visits the conceited man\nThe second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.\nFor, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;That is a queer hat you are wearing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is a hat for salutes,\u0026rdquo; the conceited man replied. \u0026ldquo;It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes?\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.\n\u0026ldquo;Clap your hands, one against the other,\u0026rdquo; the conceited man now directed him.\nThe little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.\n\u0026ldquo;This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,\u0026rdquo; the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.\nAfter five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game\u0026rsquo;s monotony.\n\u0026ldquo;And what should one do to make the hat come down?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nBut the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really admire me very much?\u0026rdquo; he demanded of the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;What does that mean—\u0026lsquo;admire\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you are the only man on your planet!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I admire you,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, \u0026ldquo;but what is there in that to interest you so much?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the little prince went away.\n\u0026ldquo;The grown-ups are certainly very odd,\u0026rdquo; he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.\nChapter 12 # the little prince visits the tippler\nThe next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing there?\u0026rdquo; he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.\n\u0026ldquo;I am drinking,\u0026rdquo; replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you drinking?\u0026rdquo; demanded the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;So that I may forget,\u0026rdquo; replied the tippler.\n\u0026ldquo;Forget what?\u0026rdquo; inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.\n\u0026ldquo;Forget that I am ashamed,\u0026rdquo; the tippler confessed, hanging his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Ashamed of what?\u0026rdquo; insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.\n\u0026ldquo;Ashamed of drinking!\u0026rdquo; The tipler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.\nAnd the little prince went away, puzzled.\n\u0026ldquo;The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,\u0026rdquo; he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.\nChapter 13 # the little prince visits the businessman\nThe fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince\u0026rsquo;s arrival.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; the little prince said to him. \u0026ldquo;Your cigarette has gone out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. FIfteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven\u0026rsquo;t time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Five hundred million what?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million—I can\u0026rsquo;t stop\u0026hellip; I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don\u0026rsquo;t amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Five-hundred-and-one million what?\u0026rdquo; repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.\nThe businessman raised his head.\n\u0026ldquo;During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don\u0026rsquo;t get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time—well, this is it! I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Millions of what?\u0026rdquo;\nThe businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.\n\u0026ldquo;Millions of those little objects,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;which one sometimes sees in the sky.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Flies?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, no. Little glittering objects.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bees?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! You mean the stars?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s it. The stars.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what do you do with these stars?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do I do with them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing. I own them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You own the stars?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I have already seen a king who—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what good does it do you to own the stars?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It does me the good of making me rich.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what good does it do you to be rich?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This man,\u0026rdquo; the little prince said to himself, \u0026ldquo;reasons a little like my poor tippler\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nNevertheless, he still had some more questions.\n\u0026ldquo;How is it possible for one to own the stars?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;To whom do they belong?\u0026rdquo; the businessman retorted, peevishly.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. To nobody.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that all that is necessary?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that is true,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;And what do you do with them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I administer them,\u0026rdquo; replied the businessman. \u0026ldquo;I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince was still not satisfied.\n\u0026ldquo;If I owned a silk scarf,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No. But I can put them in the bank.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever does that mean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And that is all?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is enough,\u0026rdquo; said the businessman.\n\u0026ldquo;It is entertaining,\u0026rdquo; thought the little prince. \u0026ldquo;It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence.\u0026rdquo;\nOn matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups.\n\u0026ldquo;I myself own a flower,\u0026rdquo; he continued his conversation with the businessman, \u0026ldquo;which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.\n\u0026ldquo;The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,\u0026rdquo; he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.\nChapter 14 # the little prince visits the lamplighter\nThe fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:\n\u0026ldquo;It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Those are the orders,\u0026rdquo; replied the lamplighter. \u0026ldquo;Good morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are the orders?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he lighted his lamp again.\n\u0026ldquo;But why have you just lighted it again?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Those are the orders,\u0026rdquo; replied the lamplighter.\n\u0026ldquo;I do not understand,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;There is nothing to understand,\u0026rdquo; said the lamplighter. \u0026ldquo;Orders are orders. Good morning.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he put out his lamp.\nThen he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.\n\u0026ldquo;I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the orders have been changed since that time?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The orders have not been changed,\u0026rdquo; said the lamplighter. \u0026ldquo;That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then what?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Then—the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is not funny at all!\u0026rdquo; said the lamplighter. \u0026ldquo;While we have been talking together a month has gone by.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A month?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he lighted his lamp again.\nAs the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.\n\u0026ldquo;You know,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I always want to rest,\u0026rdquo; said the lamplighter.\nFor it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time.\nThe little prince went on with his explanation:\n\u0026ldquo;Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk—and the day will last as long as you like.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t do me much good,\u0026rdquo; said the lamplighter. \u0026ldquo;The one thing I love in life is to sleep.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then you\u0026rsquo;re unlucky,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;I am unlucky,\u0026rdquo; said the lamplighter. \u0026ldquo;Good morning.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he put out his lamp.\n\u0026ldquo;That man,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, \u0026ldquo;that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.\u0026rdquo;\nHe breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:\n\u0026ldquo;That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nWhat the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!\nChapter 15 # the little prince visits the geographer\nThe sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, look! Here is an explorer!\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.\nThe little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!\n\u0026ldquo;Where do you come from?\u0026rdquo; the old gentleman said to him.\n\u0026ldquo;What is that big book?\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;What are you doing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am a geographer,\u0026rdquo; said the old gentleman.\n\u0026ldquo;What is a geographer?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is very interesting,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;Here at last is a man who has a real profession!\u0026rdquo; And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.\n\u0026ldquo;Your planet is very beautiful,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Has it any oceans?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell you,\u0026rdquo; said the geographer.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah!\u0026rdquo; The little prince was disappointed. \u0026ldquo;Has it any mountains?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell you,\u0026rdquo; said the geographer.\n\u0026ldquo;And towns, and rivers, and deserts?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell you that, either.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you are a geographer!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; the geographer said. \u0026ldquo;But I am not an explorer. I haven\u0026rsquo;t a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer\u0026rsquo;s moral character.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why is that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why is that?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know some one,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, \u0026ldquo;who would make a bad explorer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One goes to see it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.\u0026rdquo;\nThe geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;But you—you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.\n\u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo; said the geographer expectantly.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, where I live,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, \u0026ldquo;it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One never knows,\u0026rdquo; said the geographer.\n\u0026ldquo;I have also a flower.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We do not record flowers,\u0026rdquo; said the geographer.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We do not record them,\u0026rdquo; said the geographer, \u0026ldquo;because they are ephemeral.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What does that mean—\u0026rsquo;ephemeral\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Geographies,\u0026rdquo; said the geographer, \u0026ldquo;are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,\u0026rdquo; the little prince interrupted. \u0026ldquo;What does that mean––\u0026rsquo;ephemeral\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,\u0026rdquo; said the geographer. \u0026ldquo;The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But what does that mean—\u0026rsquo;ephemeral\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.\n\u0026ldquo;It means, \u0026lsquo;which is in danger of speedy disappearance.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Certainly it is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My flower is ephemeral,\u0026rdquo; the little prince said to himself, \u0026ldquo;and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!\u0026rdquo;\nThat was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.\n\u0026ldquo;What place would you advise me to visit now?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The planet Earth,\u0026rdquo; replied the geographer. \u0026ldquo;It has a good reputation.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.\nChapter 16 # the narrator discusses the Earth\u0026rsquo;s lamplighters\nSo then the seventh planet was the Earth.\nThe Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men—that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.\nTo give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps.\nSeen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe; then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.\nOnly the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole—only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year.\nChapter 17 # the little prince makes the acquaintance of the snake\nWhen one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.\nThe grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.\nWhen the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.\n\u0026ldquo;Good evening,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince courteously.\n\u0026ldquo;Good evening,\u0026rdquo; said the snake.\n\u0026ldquo;What planet is this on which I have come down?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;This is the Earth; this is Africa,\u0026rdquo; the snake answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large,\u0026rdquo; said the snake.\nThe little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again\u0026hellip; Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is beautiful,\u0026rdquo; the snake said. \u0026ldquo;What has brought you here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have been having some trouble with a flower,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah!\u0026rdquo; said the snake.\nAnd they were both silent.\n\u0026ldquo;Where are the men?\u0026rdquo; the little prince at last took up the conversation again. \u0026ldquo;It is a little lonely in the desert\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is also lonely among men,\u0026rdquo; the snake said.\nThe little prince gazed at him for a long time.\n\u0026ldquo;You are a funny animal,\u0026rdquo; he said at last. \u0026ldquo;You are no thicker than a finger\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,\u0026rdquo; said the snake.\nThe little prince smiled.\n\u0026ldquo;You are not very powerful. You haven\u0026rsquo;t even any feet. You cannot even travel\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,\u0026rdquo; said the snake.\nHe twined himself around the little prince\u0026rsquo;s ankle, like a golden bracelet.\n\u0026ldquo;Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,\u0026rdquo; the snake spoke again. \u0026ldquo;But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince made no reply.\n\u0026ldquo;You move me to pity—you are so weak on this Earth made of granite,\u0026rdquo; the snake said. \u0026ldquo;I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh! I understand you very well,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;But why do you always speak in riddles?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I solve them all,\u0026rdquo; said the snake.\nAnd they were both silent.\nChapter 18 # the little prince goes looking for men and meets a flower\nThe little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the flower.\n\u0026ldquo;Where are the men?\u0026rdquo; the little prince asked, politely.\nThe flower had once seen a caravan passing.\n\u0026ldquo;Men?\u0026rdquo; she echoed. \u0026ldquo;I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye,\u0026rdquo; said the flower.\nChapter 19 # the little prince climbs a mountain range\nAfter that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. \u0026ldquo;From a mountain as high as this one,\u0026rdquo; he said to himself, \u0026ldquo;I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBut he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; he said courteously.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning—Good morning—Good morning,\u0026rdquo; answered the echo.\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you—Who are you—Who are you?\u0026rdquo; answered the echo.\n\u0026ldquo;Be my friends. I am all alone,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;I am all alone—all alone—all alone,\u0026rdquo; answered the echo.\n\u0026ldquo;What a queer planet!\u0026rdquo; he thought. \u0026ldquo;It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them\u0026hellip; On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nChapter 20 # the little prince discovers a garden of roses\nBut it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nHe was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the roses.\nThe little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower.\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo; he demanded, thunderstruck.\n\u0026ldquo;We are roses,\u0026rdquo; the roses said.\nAnd he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!\n\u0026ldquo;She would be very much annoyed,\u0026rdquo; he said to himself, \u0026ldquo;if she should see that\u0026hellip; She would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life—for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThen he went on with his reflections: \u0026ldquo;I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees—and one of them perhaps extinct forever\u0026hellip; That doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me a very great prince\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he lay down in the grass and cried.\nChapter 21 # the little prince befriends the fox\nIt was then that the fox appeared.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the fox.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.\n\u0026ldquo;I am right here,\u0026rdquo; the voice said, \u0026ldquo;under the apple tree.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince, and added, \u0026ldquo;You are very pretty to look at.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am a fox,\u0026rdquo; the fox said.\n\u0026ldquo;Come and play with me,\u0026rdquo; proposed the little prince. \u0026ldquo;I am so unhappy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot play with you,\u0026rdquo; the fox said. \u0026ldquo;I am not tamed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! Please excuse me,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\nBut, after some thought, he added:\n\u0026ldquo;What does that mean—‘tame\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You do not live here,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;What is it that you are looking for?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am looking for men,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;What does that mean—‘tame\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Men,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;I am looking for friends. What does that mean—‘tame\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is an act too often neglected,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. It means to establish ties.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;‘To establish ties\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just that,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am beginning to understand,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;There is a flower\u0026hellip; I think that she has tamed me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is possible,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, but this is not on the Earth!\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\nThe fox seemed perplexed, and very curious.\n\u0026ldquo;On another planet?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are there hunters on that planet?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing is perfect,\u0026rdquo; sighed the fox.\nBut he came back to his idea.\n\u0026ldquo;My life is very monotonous,\u0026rdquo; the fox said. \u0026ldquo;I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.\n\u0026ldquo;Please—tame me!\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to, very much,\u0026rdquo; the little prince replied. \u0026ldquo;But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One only understands the things that one tames,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What must I do, to tame you?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;You must be very patient,\u0026rdquo; replied the fox. \u0026ldquo;First you will sit down at a little distance from me—like that—in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe next day the little prince came back.\n\u0026ldquo;It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;If, for example, you come at four o\u0026rsquo;clock in the afternoon, then at three o\u0026rsquo;clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o\u0026rsquo;clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you\u0026hellip; One must observe the proper rites\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is a rite?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Those also are actions too often neglected,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.\u0026rdquo;\nSo the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near—\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; said the fox, \u0026ldquo;I shall cry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is your own fault,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that is so,\u0026rdquo; said the fox.\n\u0026ldquo;But now you are going to cry!\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that is so,\u0026rdquo; said the fox.\n\u0026ldquo;Then it has done you no good at all!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It has done me good,\u0026rdquo; said the fox, \u0026ldquo;because of the color of the wheat fields.\u0026rdquo; And then he added:\n\u0026ldquo;Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince went away, to look again at the roses.\n\u0026ldquo;You are not at all like my rose,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the roses were very much embarassed.\n\u0026ldquo;You are beautiful, but you are empty,\u0026rdquo; he went on. \u0026ldquo;One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you—the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.\nAnd he went back to meet the fox.\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is essential is invisible to the eye,\u0026rdquo; the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.\n\u0026ldquo;It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is the time I have wasted for my rose—\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.\n\u0026ldquo;Men have forgotten this truth,\u0026rdquo; said the fox. \u0026ldquo;But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am responsible for my rose,\u0026rdquo; the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.\nChapter 22 # the little prince encounters a railway switchman\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the railway switchman.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you do here?\u0026rdquo; the little prince asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand,\u0026rdquo; said the switchman. \u0026ldquo;I send off the trains that carry them: now to the right, now to the left.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman\u0026rsquo;s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.\n\u0026ldquo;They are in a great hurry,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;What are they looking for?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,\u0026rdquo; said the switchman.\nAnd a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.\n\u0026ldquo;Are they coming back already?\u0026rdquo; demanded the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;These are not the same ones,\u0026rdquo; said the switchman. \u0026ldquo;It is an exchange.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Were they not satisfied where they were?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;No one is ever satisfied where he is,\u0026rdquo; said the switchman.\nAnd they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.\n\u0026ldquo;Are they pursuing the first travelers?\u0026rdquo; demanded the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;They are pursuing nothing at all,\u0026rdquo; said the switchman. \u0026ldquo;They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Only the children know what they are looking for,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They are lucky,\u0026rdquo; the switchman said.\nChapter 23 # the little prince encounters a merchant\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; said the merchant.\nThis was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you selling those?\u0026rdquo; asked the little prince.\n\u0026ldquo;Because they save a tremendous amount of time,\u0026rdquo; said the merchant. \u0026ldquo;Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Anything you like\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As for me,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince to himself, \u0026ldquo;if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.\u0026rdquo;\nChapter 24 # the narrator and the little prince, thirsty, hunt for a well in the desert\nIt was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; I said to the little prince, \u0026ldquo;these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My friend the fox—\u0026rdquo; the little prince said to me.\n\u0026ldquo;My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because I am about to die of thirst\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:\n\u0026ldquo;It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He has no way of guessing the danger,\u0026rdquo; I said to myself. \u0026ldquo;He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBut he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:\n\u0026ldquo;I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.\nWhen we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince\u0026rsquo;s last words came reeling back into my memory:\n\u0026ldquo;Then you are thirsty, too?\u0026rdquo; I demanded.\nBut he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:\n\u0026ldquo;Water may also be good for the heart\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.\nHe was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:\n\u0026ldquo;The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.\u0026rdquo;\nI replied, \u0026ldquo;Yes, that is so.\u0026rdquo; And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.\n\u0026ldquo;The desert is beautiful,\u0026rdquo; the little prince added.\nAnd that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;What makes the desert beautiful,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, \u0026ldquo;is that somewhere it hides a well\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; I said to the little prince. \u0026ldquo;The house, the stars, the desert—what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am glad,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;that you agree with my fox.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: \u0026ldquo;What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAs his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \u0026ldquo;What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower—the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind\u0026hellip;\nAnd, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.\nChapter 25 # finding a well, the narrator and the little prince discuss his return to his planet\n\u0026ldquo;Men,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, \u0026ldquo;set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he added:\n\u0026ldquo;It is not worth the trouble\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;It is strange,\u0026rdquo; I said to the little prince. \u0026ldquo;Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you hear?\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;We have wakened the well, and it is singing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI did not want him to tire himself with the rope.\n\u0026ldquo;Leave it to me,\u0026rdquo; I said. \u0026ldquo;It is too heavy for you.\u0026rdquo;\nI hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there—happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.\n\u0026ldquo;I am thirsty for this water,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;Give me some of it to drink\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I understood what he had been looking for.\nI raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.\n\u0026ldquo;The men where you live,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, \u0026ldquo;raise five thousand roses in the same garden—and they do not find in it what they are looking for.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They do not find it,\u0026rdquo; I replied.\n\u0026ldquo;And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that is true,\u0026rdquo; I said.\nAnd the little prince added:\n\u0026ldquo;But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?\n\u0026ldquo;You must keep your promise,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.\n\u0026ldquo;What promise?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know—a muzzle for my sheep\u0026hellip; I am responsible for this flower\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:\n\u0026ldquo;Your baobabs—they look a little like cabbages.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh!\u0026rdquo;\nI had been so proud of my baobabs!\n\u0026ldquo;Your fox—his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he laughed again.\n\u0026ldquo;You are not fair, little prince,\u0026rdquo; I said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that will be all right,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;children understand.\u0026rdquo;\nSo then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.\n\u0026ldquo;You have plans that I do not know about,\u0026rdquo; I said.\nBut he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:\n\u0026ldquo;You know—my descent to the earth\u0026hellip; Tomorrow will be its anniversary.\u0026rdquo;\nThen, after a silence, he went on:\n\u0026ldquo;I came down very near here.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he flushed.\nAnd once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:\n\u0026ldquo;Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you—a week ago—you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on your way back to the place where you landed?\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince flushed again.\nAnd I added, with some hesitancy:\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?\u0026rdquo;\nThe little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions—but when one flushes does that not mean \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;?\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; I said to him, \u0026ldquo;I am a little frightened—\u0026rdquo;\nBut he interrupted me.\n\u0026ldquo;Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBut I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed\u0026hellip;\nChapter 26 # the little prince converses with the snake; the little prince consoles the narrator; the little prince returns to his planet\nBeside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:\n\u0026ldquo;Then you don\u0026rsquo;t remember. This is not the exact spot.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place.\u0026rdquo;\nI continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:\n\u0026ldquo;—Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.\u0026rdquo;\nI was only twenty meters from the wall, and I still saw nothing.\nAfter a silence the little prince spoke again:\n\u0026ldquo;You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?\u0026rdquo;\nI stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.\n\u0026ldquo;Now go away,\u0026rdquo; said the little prince. \u0026ldquo;I want to get down from the wall.\u0026rdquo;\nI dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall—and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.\nI reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.\n\u0026ldquo;What does this mean?\u0026rdquo; I demanded. \u0026ldquo;Why are you talking with snakes?\u0026rdquo;\nI had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone\u0026rsquo;s rifle\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Now you can go back home—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know about that?\u0026rdquo;\nI was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.\nHe made no answer to my question, but he added:\n\u0026ldquo;I, too, am going back home today\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThen, sadly—\n\u0026ldquo;It is much farther\u0026hellip; It is much more difficult\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him\u0026hellip;\nHis look was very serious, like some one lost far away.\n\u0026ldquo;I have your sheep. And I have the sheep\u0026rsquo;s box. And I have the muzzle\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he gave me a sad smile.\nI waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.\n\u0026ldquo;Dear little man,\u0026rdquo; I said to him, \u0026ldquo;you are afraid\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.\n\u0026ldquo;I shall be much more afraid this evening\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nOnce again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.\n\u0026ldquo;Little man,\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;I want to hear you laugh again.\u0026rdquo;\nBut he said to me:\n\u0026ldquo;Tonight, it will be a year\u0026hellip; My star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Little man,\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;tell me that it is only a bad dream—this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBut he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:\n\u0026ldquo;The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember—how good it was.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens\u0026hellip; they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe laughed again.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are you trying to say?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All men have the stars,\u0026rdquo; he answered, \u0026ldquo;but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You—you alone—will have the stars as no one else has them—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are you trying to say?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night\u0026hellip; You—only you—will have stars that can laugh!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he laughed again.\n\u0026ldquo;And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure\u0026hellip;And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh!\u0026rsquo; And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he laughed again.\n\u0026ldquo;It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:\n\u0026ldquo;Tonight—you know\u0026hellip; Do not come.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I shall not leave you,\u0026rdquo; I said.\n\u0026ldquo;I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I shall not leave you.\u0026rdquo;\nBut he was worried.\n\u0026ldquo;I tell you—it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes—they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I shall not leave you.\u0026rdquo;\nBut a thought came to reassure him:\n\u0026ldquo;It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.\u0026rdquo;\nThat night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:\n\u0026ldquo;Ah! You are there\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.\n\u0026ldquo;It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI said nothing.\n\u0026ldquo;You understand\u0026hellip; it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.\u0026rdquo;\nI said nothing.\n\u0026ldquo;But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI said nothing.\nHe was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:\n\u0026ldquo;You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI said nothing.\n\u0026ldquo;That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water\u0026hellip;\nAnd he too said nothing more, becuase he was crying\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Here it is. Let me go on by myself.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:\n\u0026ldquo;You know—my flower\u0026hellip; I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so naïve! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nI too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.\n\u0026ldquo;There now—that is all\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.\nThere was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.\nChapter 27 # the narrator\u0026rsquo;s afterthoughts\nAnd now six years have already gone by\u0026hellip; I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: \u0026ldquo;I am tired.\u0026rdquo;\nNow my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say—not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body\u0026hellip; and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells\u0026hellip;\nBut there is one extraordinary thing\u0026hellip; when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower\u0026hellip;\nAt one time I say to myself: \u0026ldquo;Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.\nBut at another time I say to myself: \u0026ldquo;At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; And then the little bells are changed to tears\u0026hellip;\nHere, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has—yes or no?—eaten a rose\u0026hellip;\nLook up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes\u0026hellip;\nAnd no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!\nThis is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.\nLook at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognize it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/docs/the-little-prince/","section":"Documentation","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eSAINT-EXUPÉRY, Antoine de (1900-44).
